Our analysis on two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\\\\Theta(m\\\\log n)$, without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm. Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and for continuous data streams.

This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems): specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here, in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs. NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.',\n",

Traditional studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition, are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently as information becoming more complex.   The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic, psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles.

The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a communication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their respective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of the senders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message being transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has advantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding, is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme, achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian cases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate regions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the high-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer considerable improvements over these existing results.',\n",
              " 'Revisiting the Issues On Netflow Sample and Export Performance.  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router. Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted. However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria. In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss of monitoring detail.',\n",

Algorithm is based on certain features of p-adic numbers and p-adic norm. p-adic coding algorithm may be considered as of generalization a popular compression technique - arithmetic coding algorithms.

              " 'Universal Source Coding for Monotonic and Fast Decaying Monotonic   Distributions.  We study universal compression of sequences generated by monotonic distributions. We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet of size $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \\\\log (n/k^3)$ bits, where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise, for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\\\\epsilon})$ bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic distributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of $O(n^{1/3+\\\\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a method to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived. The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions. Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence is governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose empirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to those in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in the empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual sequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood description length may still be achievable.',\n",

              " 'Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed   Consensus.  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate, or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link. These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate. The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2) establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail; and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.',\n",

Here we describe a simple and effective approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression. On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in Bioinformatics.',\n",
              " 'On the Kolmogorov-Chaitin Complexity for short sequences.  A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the shortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of applicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a particular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter, for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable definition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences. Additionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found across the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional cellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.',\n",

              " 'Phase Transitions in the Coloring of Random Graphs.  We consider the problem of coloring the vertices of a large sparse random graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).   We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree (number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses. First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine their asymptotic values for large number of colors.   Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.',\n",
              " \"Parametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimization.  This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning (PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.\",\n",
              " 'Antenna Combining for the MIMO Downlink Channel.  A multiple antenna downlink channel where limited channel feedback is available to the transmitter is considered. In a vector downlink channel (single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to transmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter has very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel feedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback requirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number of antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method that minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby minimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is shown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining because minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization of signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to quantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user selection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.',\n",

We prove that Bimatrix, the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game, is complete for the complexity class PPAD Polynomial Parity Argument, Directed version) introduced by Papadimitriou in 1991.   This is the first of a series of results concerning the complexity of Nash equilibria. In particular, we prove the following theorems:   Bimatrix does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time. The smoothed complexity of the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm and, in fact, of any algorithm for Bimatrix is not polynomial unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in randomized polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that, even in the simplest form of non-cooperative games, equilibrium computation and approximation are polynomial-time equivalent to fixed point computation. Our results also have two broad complexity implications in mathematical economics and operations research: Arrow-Debreu market equilibria are PPAD-hard to compute. The P-Matrix Linear Complementary Problem is computationally harder than convex programming unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time.',\n",

A k-query Locally Decodable Code (LDC) encodes an n-bit message x as an N-bit codeword C(x), such that one can probabilistically recover any bit x_i of the message by querying only k bits of the codeword C(x), even after some constant fraction of codeword bits has been corrupted. The major goal of LDC related research is to establish the optimal trade-off between length and query complexity of such codes.   Recently [Y] introduced a novel technique for constructing locally decodable codes and vastly improved the upper bounds for code length. The technique is based on Mersenne primes. In this paper we extend the work of [Y] and argue that further progress via these methods is tied to progress on an old number theory question regarding the size of the largest prime factors of Mersenne numbers.   Specifically, we show that every Mersenne number m=2^t-1 that has a prime factor p>m^\\\\gamma yields a family of k(\\\\gamma)-query locally decodable codes of length Exp(n^{1/t}). Conversely, if for some fixed k and all \\\\epsilon > 0 one can use the technique of [Y] to obtain a family of k-query LDCs of length Exp(n^\\\\epsilon); then infinitely many Mersenne numbers have prime factors arger than known currently.',\n",
              " \"Information Theoretic Proofs of Entropy Power Inequalities.  While most useful information theoretic inequalities can be deduced from the basic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy power inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs of the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher information or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de Bruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these proofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing argument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an integration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these ingredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual information inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information inequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\\\\'u used in earlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it relies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then generalized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's generalized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and Johnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's covariance-constrained EPI, and Costa's concavity inequality for the entropy power.\",\n",

We describe and analyze the joint source/channel coding properties of a class of sparse graphical codes based on compounding a low-density generator matrix (LDGM) code with a low-density parity check (LDPC) code. Our first pair of theorems establish that there exist codes from this ensemble, with all degrees remaining bounded independently of block length, that are simultaneously optimal as both source and channel codes when encoding and decoding are performed optimally. More precisely, in the context of lossy compression, we prove that finite degree constructions can achieve any pair $(R, D)$ on the rate-distortion curve of the binary symmetric source. In the context of channel coding, we prove that finite degree codes can achieve any pair $(C, p)$ on the capacity-noise curve of the binary symmetric channel. Next, we show that our compound construction has a nested structure that can be exploited to achieve the Wyner-Ziv bound for source coding with side information (SCSI), as well as the Gelfand-Pinsker bound for channel coding with side information (CCSI).

Most of the deployed IEEE 802.11e Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) use infrastructure Basic Service Set (BSS) in which an Access Point (AP) serves as a gateway between wired and wireless domains. We present the unfairness problem between the uplink and the downlink flows of any Access Category (AC) in the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) when the default settings of the EDCA parameters are used. We propose a simple analytical model to calculate the EDCA parameter settings that achieve weighted fair resource allocation for all uplink and downlink flows. We also propose a simple model-assisted measurement-based dynamic EDCA parameter adaptation algorithm. Moreover, our dynamic solution addresses the differences in the transport layer and the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer interactions of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). We show that proposed Contention Window (CW) and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limit adaptation at the AP provides fair UDP and TCP access between uplink and downlink flows of the same AC while preserving prioritization among ACs.',\n",

We relax this assumption by considering extensive games where agents may be unaware of the complete structure of the game.

We show how such games can be represented; the key idea is to describe the game from the point of view of every agent at every node of the game tree. We provide a generalization of Nash equilibrium and show that every game with awareness has a generalized Nash equilibrium. Finally, we extend these results to games with awareness of unawareness, where a player i may be aware that a player j can make moves that i is not aware of, and to subjective games, where payers may have no common knowledge regarding the actual game and their beliefs are incompatible with a common prior.',\n",

              " 'Physical Layer Network Coding.  A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired network is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may reach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other nodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as an interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE 802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at the physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting advantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among nodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding arithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves for equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve 100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and straightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More specifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that of traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher than 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based network coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for boosting network capacity.',\n",

The left regular matrix representation has been shown to naturally result in space-time codes meeting the additional constraints required for DSTCs. The DSTCs so constructed have the salient feature of reduced Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding complexity. In particular, the ML decoding of these codes can be performed by applying the lattice decoder algorithm on a lattice of four times lesser dimension than what is required in general. Moreover these codes have a uniform distribution of power among the relays and in time, thus leading to a low Peak to Average Power Ratio at the relays.',\n",

This modeling is used to perform a case study on a well-known pattern recognition benchmark: the UCI Thyroid Disease Database. Empirical evidence is presented of the training time probability distribution exhibiting a heavy tail behavior, meaning a big probability mass of long executions. This fact is exploited to reduce the training time cost by applying two simple restart strategies.

The second, assumes null knowledge, yielding a reduction ranging from 9% to 23%.',\n",

The aim is to find the optimal rates at which the sources should be compressed and the network flows using which they should be transmitted so that the cost of the transmission is minimal. We consider networks with capacity constraints and linear cost functions. The problem is complicated by the fact that the description of the feasible rate region of distributed source coding problems typically has a number of constraints that is exponential in the number of sources. This renders general purpose solvers inefficient.

We introduce the straggler identification problem, in which an algorithm must determine the identities of the remaining members of a set after it has had a large number of insertion and deletion operations performed on it, and now has relatively few remaining members. The goal is to do this in o(n) space, where n is the total number of identities. The straggler identification problem has applications, for example, in determining the set of unacknowledged packets in a high-bandwidth multicast data stream. We provide a deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem that uses only O(d log n) bits and is based on a novel application of Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials. This solution can identify any subset of d stragglers from a set of n O(log n)-bit identifiers, assuming that there are no false deletions of identities not already in the set. Indeed, we give a lower bound argument that shows that any small-space deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem cannot be guaranteed to handle false deletions. Nevertheless, we show that there is a simple randomized solution using O(d log n log(1/epsilon)) bits that can maintain a multiset and solve the straggler identification problem, tolerating false deletions, where epsilon>0 is a user-defined parameter bounding the probability of an incorrect response. This randomized solution is based on a new type of Bloom filter, which we call the invertible Bloom filter.\",\n",

In this paper we address the problem of finding the sensing capacity of sensor networks for a class of linear observation models and a fixed SNR regime. Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions reliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the phenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR of the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements required for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely dealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was motivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive these bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm independent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this direction we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to the probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion criteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper bounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity goes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that disproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our next main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on sensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing diversity is related to the effective \\\\emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect to the field. In this direction we show the following results (a) Sensing capacity goes down as sensing diversity per sensor goes down; (b) Random sampling (coverage) of the field by sensors is better than contiguous location sampling (coverage).\",\n",

In this two-part paper, we consider the multiantenna multihop relay channels in which the source signal arrives at the destination through N independent relaying hops in series. The main concern of this work is to design relaying strategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity is maximized. In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy with which the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. More specifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the AF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and arbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function of the number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results on the DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that these results have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results are applied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to the Rayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward (PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PF scheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significant power gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive the upper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can be achieved by partitioning the multihop channel into AF subchannels.',\n",

By reducing from the problem of computing the pathwidth of a graph, we show that the problem of determining the pathwidth of a representable matroid is NP-hard. Consequently, the problem of computing the trellis-width of a linear code is also NP-hard. For a finite field $\\\\F$, we also consider the class of $\\\\F$-representable matroids of pathwidth at most $w$, and correspondingly, the family of linear codes over $\\\\F$ with trellis-width at most $w$. These are easily seen to be minor-closed. Since these matroids (and codes) have branchwidth at most $w$, a result of Geelen and Whittle shows that such matroids (and the corresponding codes) are characterized by finitely many excluded minors. We provide the complete list of excluded minors for $w=1$, and give a partial list for $w=2$.',\n",

With the great success in simulating many intelligent behaviors using computing devices, there has been an ongoing debate whether all conscious activities are computational processes. In this paper, the answer to this question is shown to be no. A certain phenomenon of consciousness is demonstrated to be fully represented as a computational process using a quantum computer. Based on the computability criterion discussed with Turing machines, the model constructed is shown to necessarily involve a non-computable element. The concept that this is solely a quantum effect and does not work for a classical case is also discussed.',\n",

              " \"Towards Informative Statistical Flow Inversion.  A problem which has recently attracted research attention is that of estimating the distribution of flow sizes in internet traffic. On high traffic links it is sometimes impossible to record every packet. Researchers have approached the problem of estimating flow lengths from sampled packet data in two separate ways. Firstly, different sampling methodologies can be tried to more accurately measure the desired system parameters. One such method is the sample-and-hold method where, if a packet is sampled, all subsequent packets in that flow are sampled. Secondly, statistical methods can be used to ``invert'' the sampled data and produce an estimate of flow lengths from a sample.   In this paper we propose, implement and test two variants on the sample-and-hold method. In addition we show how the sample-and-hold method can be inverted to get an estimation of the genuine distribution of flow sizes. Experiments are carried out on real network traces to compare standard packet sampling with three variants of sample-and-hold. The methods are compared for their ability to reconstruct the genuine distribution of flow sizes in the traffic.\",\n",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytic derivation of the per object hit ratio of LRU that can be obtained in constant time without requiring laborious numeric computations or simulation.

The set of solutions of random constraint satisfaction problems (zero energy groundstates of mean-field diluted spin glasses) undergoes several structural phase transitions as the amount of constraints is increased. This set first breaks down into a large number of well separated clusters. At the freezing transition, which is in general distinct from the clustering one, some variables (spins) take the same value in all solutions of a given cluster. In this paper we study the critical behavior around the freezing transition, which appears in the unfrozen phase as the divergence of the sizes of the rearrangements induced in response to the modification of a variable. The formalism is developed on generic constraint satisfaction problems and applied in particular to the random satisfiability of boolean formulas and to the coloring of random graphs. The computation is first performed in random tree ensembles, for which we underline a connection with percolation models and with the reconstruction problem of information theory. The validity of these results for the original random ensembles is then discussed in the framework of the cavity method.',\n",

The Grassmann manifold G_{n,p}(L) is the set of all p-dimensional planes (through the origin) in the n-dimensional Euclidean space L^{n}, where L is either R or C. This paper considers an unequal dimensional quantization in which a source in G_{n,p}(L) is quantized through a code in G_{n,q}(L), where p and q are not necessarily the same. It is different from most works in literature where p\\\\equiv q. The analysis for unequal dimensional quantization is based on the volume of a metric ball in G_{n,p}(L) whose center is in G_{n,q}(L). Our chief result is a closed-form formula for the volume of a metric ball when the radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary n, p, q and L, while previous results pertained only to some special cases. Based on this volume formula, several bounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization rate is sufficiently high. The lower and upper bounds on the distortion rate function are asymptotically identical, and so precisely quantify the asymptotic rate distortion tradeoff. We also show that random codes are asymptotically optimal in the sense that they achieve the minimum achievable distortion with probability one as n and the code rate approach infinity linearly. Finally, we discuss some applications of the derived results to communication theory. A geometric interpretation in the Grassmann manifold is developed for capacity calculation of additive white Gaussian noise channel. Further, the derived distortion rate function is beneficial to characterizing the effect of beamforming matrix selection in multi-antenna communications.',\n",

Sphere decoding (SD) is a low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detection algorithm, which has been adapted for different linear channels in digital communications. The complexity of the SD has been shown to be exponential in some cases, and polynomial in others and under certain assumptions. The sphere radius and the number of nodes visited throughout the tree traversal search are the decisive factors for the complexity of the algorithm. The radius problem has been addressed and treated widely in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new structure for SD, which drastically reduces the overall complexity. The complexity is measured in terms of the floating point operations per second (FLOPS) and the number of nodes visited throughout the algorithm tree search. This reduction in the complexity is due to the ability of decoding the real and imaginary parts of each jointly detected symbol independently of each other, making use of the new lattice representation. We further show by simulations that the new approach achieves 80% reduction in the overall complexity compared to the conventional SD for a 2x2 system, and almost 50% reduction for the 4x4 and 6x6 cases, thus relaxing the requirements for hardware implementation.',\n",

Open Access to particle physics literature does not sound particularly new or exciting, since particle physicists have been reading preprints for decades, and arXiv.org for 15 years.

However, given the field's history of preprints and eprints, it is well suited to a change to a fully Open Access publishing model. Data shows that 90% of HEP published literature is freely available online, meaning that HEP libraries have little need for expensive journal subscriptions. As libraries begin to cancel journal subscriptions, the peer review process will lose its primary source of funding. Open Access publishing models can potentially address this issue. European physicists and funding agencies are proposing a consortium, SCOAP3, that might solve many of the objections to traditional Open Access publishing models in Particle Physics.

The decoding algorithm, called interior point decoding, is designed for linear vector channels. The linear vector channels include many practically important channels such as inter symbol interference channels and partial response channels. It is shown that the maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) rule for a linear vector channel can be relaxed to a convex optimization problem, which is called a relaxed MLD problem. The proposed decoding algorithm is based on a numerical optimization technique so called interior point method with barrier function. Approximate variations of the gradient descent and the Newton methods are used to solve the convex optimization problem. In a decoding process of the proposed algorithm, a search point always lies in the fundamental polytope defined based on a low-density parity-check matrix.

In this paper, redundant random matrix ensembles (abbreviated as redundant random ensembles) are defined and their stopping set (SS) weight distributions are analyzed. A redundant random ensemble consists of a set of binary matrices with linearly dependent rows. These linearly dependent rows (redundant rows) significantly reduce the number of stopping sets of small size. An upper and lower bound on the average SS weight distribution of the redundant random ensembles are shown. From these bounds, the trade-off between the number of redundant rows (corresponding to decoding complexity of BP on BEC) and the critical exponent of the asymptotic growth rate of SS weight distribution (corresponding to decoding performance) can be derived. It is shown that, in some cases, a dense matrix with linearly dependent rows yields asymptotically (i.e., in the regime of small erasure probability) better performance than regular LDPC matrices with comparable parameters.',\n",

Within the program of finding axiomatizations for various parts of computability logic, it was proved earlier that the logic of interactive Turing reduction is exactly the implicative fragment of Heyting's intuitionistic calculus.

We restrict the class of schedulers to a class of admissible schedulers which better model adversarial behaviour. These admissible schedulers base their decision solely on the past behaviour of the system that is visible to the adversary.   Using this, we propose a definition of anonymity: for all admissible schedulers the identity of the users and the observations of the adversary are independent stochastic variables.

We consider power allocation algorithms for fixed-rate transmission over Nakagami-m non-ergodic block-fading channels with perfect transmitter and receiver channel state information and discrete input signal constellations, under both short- and long-term power constraints. Optimal power allocation schemes are shown to be direct applications of previous results in the literature. We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is given by m times the Singleton bound. We also illustrate the significant gains available by employing long-term power constraints. In particular, we analyze the optimal long-term solution, showing that zero outage can be achieved provided that the corresponding short-term SNR exponent with the same system parameters is strictly greater than one. Conversely, if the short-term SNR exponent is smaller than one, we show that zero outage cannot be achieved. In this case, we derive the corresponding long-term SNR exponent as a function of the Singleton bound. Due to the nature of the expressions involved, the complexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for system implementation. We therefore propose simple sub-optimal power allocation schemes whose outage probability performance is very close to the minimum outage probability obtained by optimal schemes.

This results in under-utilization of idle system resources thereby decreasing overall system throughput. In our research, we have developed a prototype framework called ReSHAPE, which supports dynamic resizing of parallel MPI applications executing on distributed memory platforms. The resizing library in ReSHAPE includes support for releasing and acquiring processors and efficiently redistributing application state to a new set of processors. In this paper, we derive an algorithm for redistributing two-dimensional block-cyclic arrays from $P$ to $Q$ processors, organized as 2-D processor grids. The algorithm ensures a contention-free communication schedule for data redistribution if $P_r \\\\leq Q_r$ and $P_c \\\\leq Q_c$. In other cases, the algorithm implements circular row and column shifts on the communication schedule to minimize node contention.',\n",
              " 'Analysis of Inter-Domain Traffic Correlations: Random Matrix Theory   Approach.  The traffic behavior of University of Louisville network with the interconnected backbone routers and the number of Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) subnets is investigated using the Random Matrix Theory (RMT) approach. We employ the system of equal interval time series of traffic counts at all router to router and router to subnet connections as a representation of the inter-VLAN traffic. The cross-correlation matrix C of the traffic rate changes between different traffic time series is calculated and tested against null-hypothesis of random interactions.   The majority of the eigenvalues \\\\lambda_{i} of matrix C fall within the bounds predicted by the RMT for the eigenvalues of random correlation matrices. The distribution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors outside of the RMT bounds displays prominent and systematic deviations from the RMT predictions. Moreover, these deviations are stable in time.   The method we use provides a unique possibility to accomplish three concurrent tasks of traffic analysis. The method verifies the uncongested state of the network, by establishing the profile of random interactions. It recognizes the system-specific large-scale interactions, by establishing the profile of stable in time non-random interactions. Finally, by looking into the eigenstatistics we are able to detect and allocate anomalies of network traffic interactions.',\n",

              " \"Randomness Extraction via Delta-Biased Masking in the Presence of a   Quantum Attacker.  Randomness extraction is of fundamental importance for information-theoretic cryptography. It allows to transform a raw key about which an attacker has some limited knowledge into a fully secure random key, on which the attacker has essentially no information. Up to date, only very few randomness-extraction techniques are known to work against an attacker holding quantum information on the raw key. This is very much in contrast to the classical (non-quantum) setting, which is much better understood and for which a vast amount of different techniques are known and proven to work.   We prove a new randomness-extraction technique, which is known to work in the classical setting, to be secure against a quantum attacker as well. Randomness extraction is done by XOR'ing a so-called delta-biased mask to the raw key. Our result allows to extend the classical applications of this extractor to the quantum setting. We discuss the following two applications. We show how to encrypt a long message with a short key, information-theoretically secure against a quantum attacker, provided that the attacker has enough quantum uncertainty on the message. This generalizes the concept of entropically-secure encryption to the case of a quantum attacker. As second application, we show how to do error-correction without leaking partial information to a quantum attacker. Such a technique is useful in settings where the raw key may contain errors, since standard error-correction techniques may provide the attacker with information on, say, a secret key that was used to obtain the raw key.\",\n",

A multiple input multiple output (MIMO) two-way relay channel is considered, where two sources want to exchange messages with each other using multiple relay nodes, and both the sources and relay nodes are equipped with multiple antennas. Both the sources are assumed to have equal number of antennas and have perfect channel state information (CSI) for all the channels of the MIMO two-way relay channel, whereas, each relay node is either assumed to have CSI for its transmit and receive channel (the coherent case) or no CSI for any of the channels (the non-coherent case). The main results in this paper are on the scaling behavior of the capacity region of the MIMO two-way relay channel with increasing number of relay nodes. In the coherent case, the capacity region of the MIMO two-way relay channel is shown to scale linearly with the number of antennas at source nodes and logarithmically with the number of relay nodes. In the non-coherent case, the capacity region is shown to scale linearly with the number of antennas at the source nodes and logarithmically with the signal to noise ratio.',\n",

The proposed formal presentation of a trace constitutes a simple and pedagogical approach for teaching Prolog or for implementing Prolog tracers. It constitutes a form of declarative specification for the tracers. Our approach highlights qualities of the box model which made its success, but also its drawbacks and limits. As a matter of fact, the presented semantics is only one example to illustrate general problems relating to tracers and observing processes. Observing processes know, from observed processes, only their traces.

We analyze a MIMO DS-CDMA channel with a general multiuser detector including a nonlinear multiuser detector, using the replica method. In the many-user, limit the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the multiuser detector is decoupled into a bank of single-user SIMO Gaussian channels if a spatial spreading scheme is employed. On the other hand, it is decoupled into a bank of single-user MIMO Gaussian channels if a spatial spreading scheme is not employed. The spectral efficiency of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the spatial spreading scheme is comparable with that of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel using an optimal space-time block code without the spatial spreading scheme. In the case of the QPSK data modulation scheme the spectral efficiency of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the MMSE detector shows {\\\\it waterfall} behavior and is very close to the corresponding sum capacity when the system load is just below the transition point of the {\\\\it waterfall} behavior.

These classes are defined by means of shadows (projections) and by finitely many forbidden colored (lifted) subgraphs. Our characterization is motivated by the analysis of syntactical subclasses with the full computational power of NP, which were first studied by Feder and Vardi.   Our approach applies to many combinatorial problems and it induces the characterization of coloring problems (CSP) defined by means of shadows. This turns out to be related to homomorphism dualities. We prove that a class of digraphs (relational structures) defined by finitely many forbidden colored subgraphs (i.e. lifted substructures) is a CSP class if and only if all the the forbidden structures are homomorphically equivalent to trees. We show a surprising richness of coloring problems when restricted to most frequent graph classes. Using results of Ne\\\\v{s}et\\\\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez for bounded expansion classes (which include bounded degree and proper minor closed classes) we prove that the restriction of every class defined as the shadow of finitely many colored subgraphs equals to the restriction of a coloring (CSP) class.',\n",

Reliable communication over the discrete-input/continuous-output noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Rayleigh block fading channel is considered when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per degree of freedom is low. Two key problems are posed and solved to obtain the optimum discrete input. In both problems, the average and peak power per space-time slot of the input constellation are constrained. In the first one, the peak power to average power ratio (PPAPR) of the input constellation is held fixed, while in the second problem, the peak power is fixed independently of the average power. In the first PPAPR-constrained problem, the mutual information, which grows as O(SNR^2), is maximized up to second order in SNR. In the second peak-constrained problem, where the mutual information behaves as O(SNR), the structure of constellations that are optimal up to first order, or equivalently, that minimize energy/bit, are explicitly characterized. Furthermore, among constellations that are first-order optimal, those that maximize the mutual information up to second order, or equivalently, the wideband slope, are characterized. In both PPAPR-constrained and peak-constrained problems, the optimal constellations are obtained in closed-form as solutions to non-convex optimizations, and interestingly, they are found to be identical. Due to its special structure, the common solution is referred to as Space Time Orthogonal Rank one Modulation, or STORM. In both problems, it is seen that STORM provides a sharp characterization of the behavior of noncoherent MIMO capacity.',\n",

This paper considers the problem of secure coding design for a type II wiretap channel, where the main channel is noiseless and the eavesdropper channel is a general binary-input symmetric-output memoryless channel. The proposed secure error-correcting code has a nested code structure. Two secure nested coding schemes are studied for a type II Gaussian wiretap channel. The nesting is based on cosets of a good code sequence for the first scheme and on cosets of the dual of a good code sequence for the second scheme. In each case, the corresponding achievable rate-equivocation pair is derived based on the threshold behavior of good code sequences. The two secure coding schemes together establish an achievable rate-equivocation region, which almost covers the secrecy capacity-equivocation region in this case study. The proposed secure coding scheme is extended to a type II binary symmetric wiretap channel. A new achievable perfect secrecy rate, which improves upon the previously reported result by Thangaraj et al., is derived for this channel.',\n",

While the best known outerbound for the K user interference channel states that there cannot be more than K/2 degrees of freedom, it has been conjectured that in general the constant interference channel with any number of users has only one degree of freedom. In this paper, we explore the spatial degrees of freedom per orthogonal time and frequency dimension for the K user wireless interference channel where the channel coefficients take distinct values across frequency slots but are fixed in time. We answer five closely related questions. First, we show that K/2 degrees of freedom can be achieved by channel design, i.e. if the nodes are allowed to choose the best constant, finite and nonzero channel coefficient values. Second, we show that if channel coefficients can not be controlled by the nodes but are selected by nature, i.e., randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, the total number of spatial degrees of freedom for the K user interference channel is almost surely K/2 per orthogonal time and frequency dimension. Thus, only half the spatial degrees of freedom are lost due to distributed processing of transmitted and received signals on the interference channel. Third, we show that interference alignment and zero forcing suffice to achieve all the degrees of freedom in all cases. Fourth, we show that the degrees of freedom $D$ directly lead to an $\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$ capacity characterization of the form $C(SNR)=D\\\\log(1+SNR)+\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the multiple access channel, the broadcast channel, the 2 user interference channel, the 2 user MIMO X channel and the 3 user interference channel with M>1 antennas at each node.

In this two-parts paper we propose a decentralized strategy, based on a game-theoretic formulation, to find out the optimal precoding/multiplexing matrices for a multipoint-to-multipoint communication system composed of a set of wideband links sharing the same physical resources, i.e., time and bandwidth. We assume, as optimality criterion, the achievement of a Nash equilibrium and consider two alternative optimization problems: 1) the competitive maximization of mutual information on each link, given constraints on the transmit power and on the spectral mask imposed by the radio spectrum regulatory bodies; and 2) the competitive maximization of the transmission rate, using finite order constellations, under the same constraints as above, plus a constraint on the average error probability. In Part I of the paper, we start by showing that the solution set of both noncooperative games is always nonempty and contains only pure strategies. Then, we prove that the optimal precoding/multiplexing scheme for both games leads to a channel diagonalizing structure, so that both matrix-valued problems can be recast in a simpler unified vector power control game, with no performance penalty. Thus, we study this simpler game and derive sufficient conditions ensuring the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Interestingly, although derived under stronger constraints, incorporating for example spectral mask constraints, our uniqueness conditions have broader validity than previously known conditions. Finally, we assess the goodness of the proposed decentralized strategy by comparing its performance with the performance of a Pareto-optimal centralized scheme.

We present a deterministic exploration mechanism for sponsored search auctions, which enables the auctioneer to learn the relevance scores of advertisers, and allows advertisers to estimate the true value of clicks generated at the auction site. This exploratory mechanism deviates only minimally from the mechanism being currently used by Google and Yahoo! in the sense that it retains the same pricing rule, similar ranking scheme, as well as, similar mathematical structure of payoffs. In particular, the estimations of the relevance scores and true-values are achieved by providing a chance to lower ranked advertisers to obtain better slots. This allows the search engine to potentially test a new pool of advertisers, and correspondingly, enables new advertisers to estimate the value of clicks/leads generated via the auction. Both these quantities are unknown a priori, and their knowledge is necessary for the auction to operate efficiently. We show that such an exploration policy can be incorporated without any significant loss in revenue for the auctioneer. We compare the revenue of the new mechanism to that of the standard mechanism at their corresponding symmetric Nash equilibria and compute the cost of uncertainty, which is defined as the relative loss in expected revenue per impression. We also bound the loss in efficiency, as well as, in user experience due to exploration, under the same solution concept (i.e. SNE). Thus the proposed exploration mechanism learns the relevance scores while incorporating the incentive constraints from the advertisers who are selfish and are trying to maximize their own profits, and therefore, the exploration is essentially achieved via mechanism design. We also discuss variations of the new mechanism such as truthful implementations.',\n",

Inverse participation ratio (IPR) of eigenvectors of D deviates substantially from the IPR of eigenvectors of the equal time correlation matrix C.

Then, we propose to adapt these results in the context of single-hop data-gathering sensor networks. Finally, based on this proposed formalism, we propose a clustering based communication protocol for large sensor networks and demonstrate its superiority over a traditional clustering protocol.',\n",
              " \"Logic, Design & Organization of PTVD-SHAM; A Parallel Time Varying &   Data Super-helical Access Memory.  This paper encompasses a super helical memory system's design, 'Boolean logic & image-logic' as a theoretical concept of an invention-model to 'store time-data' in terms of anticipating the best memory location ever for data/time. A waterfall effect is deemed to assist the process of potential-difference output-switch into diverse logic states in quantum dot computational methods via utilizing coiled carbon nanotubes (CCNTs) and carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs). A 'quantum confinement' is thus derived for a flow of particles in a categorized quantum well substrate with a normalized capacitance rectifying high B-field flux into electromagnetic induction. Multi-access of coherent sequences of 'qubit addressing' is gained in any magnitude as pre-defined for the orientation of array displacement. Briefly, Gaussian curvature of k<0 is debated in aim of specifying the 2D electron gas characteristics in scenarios where data is stored in short intervals versus long ones e.g. when k'>(k<0) for greater CCNT diameters, space-time continuum is folded by chance for the particle. This benefits from Maxwell-Lorentz theory in Minkowski's space-time viewpoint alike to crystal oscillators for precise data timing purposes and radar systems e.g., time varying self-clocking devices in diverse geographic locations. This application could also be optional for data depository versus extraction, in the best supercomputer system's locations, autonomously. For best performance in minimizing current limiting mechanisms including electromigration, a multilevel metallization and implant process forming elevated sources/drains for the circuit's staircase pyramidal construction, is discussed accordingly.\",\n",

We convert the detection problem into a binary decoding problem, which can be easily combined with LDPC decoding. We show that, for a certain class of channels and in the absence of coding, the proposed technique provides the exact ML solution without an exponential complexity in the size of channel memory, while for some other channels, this method has a non-diminishing probability of failure as SNR increases.

              " \"Efficient supervised learning in networks with binary synapses.  Recent experimental studies indicate that synaptic changes induced by neuronal activity are discrete jumps between a small number of stable states. Learning in systems with discrete synapses is known to be a computationally hard problem. Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning algorithm that derives from Belief Propagation algorithms. We show that it performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite number of `hidden' states per synapse, that has to learn a random classification task. Such system is able to learn a number of associations close to the theoretical limit, in time which is sublinear in system size. This is to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve efficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse. Furthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden states which becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to the standard `perceptron' learning algorithm, with an additional rule for synaptic transitions which occur only if a currently presented pattern is `barely correct'. In this case, the synaptic changes are meta-plastic only (change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the synapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible states and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K visible states. We suggest this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily implemented by neurobiological systems or in hardware.\",\n",

In [5], Srijuntongsiri and Vavasis propose the \"Kantorovich-Test Subdivision algorithm\", or KTS, which is an algorithm for finding all zeros of a polynomial system in a bounded region of the plane. This algorithm can be used to find the intersections between a line and a surface. The main features of KTS are that it can operate on polynomials represented in any basis that satisfies certain conditions and that its efficiency has an upper bound that depends only on the conditioning of the problem and the choice of the basis representing the polynomial system.   This article explores in detail the dependence of the efficiency of the KTS algorithm on the choice of basis. Three bases are considered: the power, the Bernstein, and the Chebyshev bases. These three bases satisfy the basis properties required by KTS. Theoretically, Chebyshev case has the smallest upper bound on its running time. The computational results, however, do not show that Chebyshev case performs better than the other two.',\n",

Quantum pseudo-telepathy is an intriguing phenomenon which results from the application of quantum information theory to communication complexity. To demonstrate this phenomenon researchers in the field of quantum communication complexity devised a number of quantum non-locality games. The setting of these games is as follows: the players are separated so that no communication between them is possible and are given a certain computational task. When the players have access to a quantum resource called entanglement, they can accomplish the task: something that is impossible in a classical setting. To an observer who is unfamiliar with the laws of quantum mechanics it seems that the players employ some sort of telepathy; that is, they somehow exchange information without sharing a communication channel. This paper provides a formal framework for specifying, implementing, and analysing quantum non-locality games.',\n",

In this paper, we study a more general setting, in which some pairs of objects are incomparable. This generalization is relevant in applications related to rankings in sports, college admissions, or conference submissions. It also has potential applications in biology, such as comparing the evolutionary fitness of different strains of bacteria, or understanding input-output relations among a set of metabolic reactions or the causal influences among a set of interacting genes or proteins. Our results improve and extend results from two decades ago of Faigle and Tur\\\\'{a}n.   A measure of complexity of a partially ordered set (poset) is its width. Our algorithms obtain information about a poset by queries that compare two elements. We present an algorithm that sorts, i.e. completely identifies, a width w poset of size n and has query complexity O(wn + nlog(n)), which is within a constant factor of the information-theoretic lower bound. We also show that a variant of Mergesort has query complexity O(wn(log(n/w))) and total complexity O((w^2)nlog(n/w)). Faigle and Tur\\\\'{a}n have shown that the sorting problem has query complexity O(wn(log(n/w))) but did not address its total complexity.   For the related problem of determining the minimal elements of a poset, we give efficient deterministic and randomized algorithms with O(wn) query and total complexity, along with matching lower bounds for the query complexity up to a factor of 2. We generalize these results to the k-selection problem of determining the elements of height at most k. We also derive upper bounds on the total complexity of some other problems of a similar flavor.\",\n",

Analytic execution architectures have been proposed by the same authors as a means to conceptualize the cooperation between heterogeneous collectives of components such as programs, threads, states and services. Interface groups have been proposed as a means to formalize interface information concerning analytic execution architectures. These concepts are adapted to organization architectures with a focus on financial transfers. Interface groups (and monoids) now provide a technique to combine interface elements into interfaces with the flexibility to distinguish between directions of flow dependent on entity naming.   The main principle exploiting interface groups is that when composing a closed system of a collection of interacting components, the sum of their interfaces must vanish in the interface group modulo reflection. This certainly matters for financial transfer interfaces.   As an example of this, we specify an interface group and within it some specific interfaces concerning the financial transfer architecture for a part of our local academic organization.   Financial transfer interface groups arise as a special case of more general service architecture interfaces.',\n",

We start by analyzing how the overlay properties impact the efficiency of BitTorrent. We focus on the average peer set size (i.e., average number of neighbors), the time for a peer to reach its maximum peer set size, and the diameter of the overlay. In particular, we show that the later a peer arrives in a torrent, the longer it takes to reach its maximum peer set size. Then, we evaluate the impact of the maximum peer set size, the maximum number of outgoing connections per peer, and the number of NATed peers on the overlay properties. We show that BitTorrent generates a robust overlay, but that this overlay is not a random graph. In particular, the connectivity of a peer to its neighbors depends on its arriving order in the torrent. We also show that a large number of NATed peers significantly compromise the robustness of the overlay to attacks. Finally, we evaluate the impact of peer exchange on the overlay properties, and we show that it generates a chain-like overlay with a large diameter, which will adversely impact the efficiency of large torrents.',\n",

Two limiting cases are considered: the dilute limit, i.e. for those words that are used less than once a day, and the dense limit for frequent words. In both cases, extreme events occur more frequently than expected from the Poisson hypothesis. These deviations from Poisson statistics reveal non-trivial time correlations between events that are associated with bursts of activities. The distribution of waiting times is shown to behave like a stretched exponential and to have the same shape for different sets of words sharing a common frequency, thereby revealing universal features.',\n",

We first propose a simple mathematical analysis framework for the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function of the recently ratified IEEE 802.11e standard. Our analysis considers the fact that the distributed random access systems exhibit cyclic behavior. The proposed model is valid for arbitrary assignments of AC-specific Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS) values and Contention Window (CW) sizes and is the first that considers an arbitrary distribution of active Access Categories (ACs) at the stations. Validating the theoretical results via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed analysis accurately captures the EDCA saturation performance. Next, we propose a framework for multimedia capacity analysis of the EDCA function. We calculate an accurate station- and AC-specific queue utilization ratio by appropriately weighing the service time predictions of the cycle time model for different number of active stations. Based on the calculated queue utilization ratio, we design a simple model-based admission control scheme.

In many channel measurement applications, one needs to estimate some characteristics of the channels based on a limited set of measurements. This is mainly due to the highly time varying characteristics of the channel. In this contribution, it will be shown how free probability can be used for channel capacity estimation in MIMO systems. Free probability has already been applied in various application fields such as digital communications, nuclear physics and mathematical finance, and has been shown to be an invaluable tool for describing the asymptotic behaviour of many large-dimensional systems. In particular, using the concept of free deconvolution, we provide an asymptotically (w.r.t. the number of observations) unbiased capacity estimator for MIMO channels impaired with noise called the free probability based estimator. Another estimator, called the Gaussian matrix mean based estimator, is also introduced by slightly modifying the free probability based estimator. This estimator is shown to give unbiased estimation of the moments of the channel matrix for any number of observations. Also, the estimator has this property when we extend to MIMO channels with phase off-set and frequency drift, for which no estimator has been provided so far in the literature. It is also shown that both the free probability based and the Gaussian matrix mean based estimator are asymptotically unbiased capacity estimators as the number of transmit antennas go to infinity, regardless of whether phase off-set and frequency drift are present. The limitations in the two estimators are also explained. Simulations are run to assess the performance of the estimators for a low number of antennas and samples to confirm the usefulness of the asymptotic results.',\n",

We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a block 1-norm, i.e., a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual regularization by the 1-norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic model consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model misspecification. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied.',\n",

Two separate encoders observe the two components and communicate compressed versions of their observations to a common decoder. The decoder is interested in reconstructing a linear combination of X1 and X2 to within a mean-square distortion of D. We obtain an inner bound to the optimal rate-distortion region for this problem. A portion of this inner bound is achieved by a scheme that reconstructs the linear function directly rather than reconstructing the individual components X1 and X2 first. This results in a better rate region for certain parameter values. Our coding scheme relies on lattice coding techniques in contrast to more prevalent random coding arguments used to demonstrate achievable rate regions in information theory. We then consider the case of linear reconstruction of K sources and provide an inner bound to the optimal rate-distortion region.

We consider its generalisation, called the semi-local LCS problem, which arises naturally in many string-related problems. The semi-local LCS problem asks for the LCS scores for each of the input strings against every substring of the other input string, and for every prefix of each input string against every suffix of the other input string. Such a comparison pattern provides a much more detailed picture of string similarity than a single LCS score; it also arises naturally in many string-related problems. In fact, the semi-local LCS problem turns out to be fundamental for string comparison, providing a powerful and flexible alternative to classical dynamic programming. It is especially useful when the input to a string comparison problem may not be available all at once: for example, comparison of dynamically changing strings; comparison of compressed strings; parallel string comparison. The same approach can also be applied to permutation strings, providing efficient solutions for local versions of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem, and for the problem of computing a maximum clique in a circle graph. Furthermore, the semi-local LCS problem turns out to have surprising connections in a few seemingly unrelated fields, such as computational geometry and algebra of semigroups. This work is devoted to exploring the structure of the semi-local LCS problem, its efficient solutions, and its applications in string comparison and other related areas, including computational molecular biology.',\n",
              " \"Understanding the Characteristics of Internet Short Video Sharing:   YouTube as a Case Study.  Established in 2005, YouTube has become the most successful Internet site providing a new generation of short video sharing service. Today, YouTube alone comprises approximately 20% of all HTTP traffic, or nearly 10% of all traffic on the Internet. Understanding the features of YouTube and similar video sharing sites is thus crucial to their sustainable development and to network traffic engineering. In this paper, using traces crawled in a 3-month period, we present an in-depth and systematic measurement study on the characteristics of YouTube videos. We find that YouTube videos have noticeably different statistics compared to traditional streaming videos, ranging from length and access pattern, to their active life span, ratings, and comments. The series of datasets also allows us to identify the growth trend of this fast evolving Internet site in various aspects, which has seldom been explored before. We also look closely at the social networking aspect of YouTube, as this is a key driving force toward its success. In particular, we find that the links to related videos generated by uploaders' choices form a small-world network. This suggests that the videos have strong correlations with each other, and creates opportunities for developing novel caching or peer-to-peer distribution schemes to efficiently deliver videos to end users.\",\n",

They are characterized by the \\\\emph{lowest decoding complexity} among the known rate-one STBC, arising due to the complete separability of the transmitted symbols into four groups for maximum likelihood detection. The first and the second codes are delay-optimal if the number of transmit antennas is a power of 2 and even, respectively. The exact pair-wise error probability is derived to allow for the performance optimization of the two codes. Compared with existing low-decoding complexity STBC, the two new codes offer several advantages such as higher code rate, lower encoding/decoding delay and complexity, lower peak-to-average power ratio, and better performance.',\n",

Thus far, sparse representations have been exploited largely in the context of robustly estimating functions in a noisy environment from a few measurements. In this context, the existence of a basis in which the signal class under consideration is sparse is used to decrease the number of necessary measurements while controlling the approximation error. In this paper, we instead focus on applications in numerical analysis, by way of sparse representations of linear operators with the objective of minimizing the number of operations needed to perform basic operations (here, multiplication) on these operators. We represent a linear operator by a sum of rank-one operators, and show how a sparse representation that guarantees a low approximation error for the product can be obtained from analyzing an induced quadratic form. This construction in turn yields new algorithms for computing approximate matrix products.',\n",

Exploiting these reductions we obtain new results concerning the computational complexity of evaluating the interlace polynomial at a fixed point. Regarding exact evaluation, we prove that the interlace polynomial is #P-hard to evaluate at every point of the plane, except on one line, where it is trivially polynomial time computable, and four lines, where the complexity is still open. This solves a problem posed by Arratia, Bollobas and Sorkin (2004). In particular, three specializations of the two-variable interlace polynomial, the vertex-nullity interlace polynomial, the vertex-rank interlace polynomial and the independent set polynomial, are almost everywhere #P-hard to evaluate, too. For the independent set polynomial, our reductions allow us to prove that it is even hard to approximate at any point except at 0.',\n",
              " \"Communication under Strong Asynchronism.  We consider asynchronous communication over point-to-point discrete memoryless channels. The transmitter starts sending one block codeword at an instant that is uniformly distributed within a certain time period, which represents the level of asynchronism. The receiver, by means of a sequential decoder, must isolate the message without knowing when the codeword transmission starts but being cognizant of the asynchronism level A. We are interested in how quickly can the receiver isolate the sent message, particularly in the regime where A is exponentially larger than the codeword length N, which we refer to as `strong asynchronism.'   This model of sparse communication may represent the situation of a sensor that remains idle most of the time and, only occasionally, transmits information to a remote base station which needs to quickly take action.   The first result shows that vanishing error probability can be guaranteed as N tends to infinity while A grows as Exp(N*k) if and only if k does not exceed the `synchronization threshold,' a constant that admits a simple closed form expression, and is at least as large as the capacity of the synchronized channel. The second result is the characterization of a set of achievable strictly positive rates in the regime where A is exponential in N, and where the rate is defined with respect to the expected delay between the time information starts being emitted until the time the receiver makes a decision.   As an application of the first result we consider antipodal signaling over a Gaussian channel and derive a simple necessary condition between A, N, and SNR for achieving reliable communication.\",\n",

This paper derives a \\\\emph{distributed} Kalman filter to estimate a sparsely connected, large-scale, $n-$dimensional, dynamical system monitored by a network of $N$ sensors. Local Kalman filters are implemented on the ($n_l-$dimensional, where $n_l\\\\ll n$) sub-systems that are obtained after spatially decomposing the large-scale system. The resulting sub-systems overlap, which along with an assimilation procedure on the local Kalman filters, preserve an $L$th order Gauss-Markovian structure of the centralized error processes. The information loss due to the $L$th order Gauss-Markovian approximation is controllable as it can be characterized by a divergence that decreases as $L\\\\uparrow$. The order of the approximation, $L$, leads to a lower bound on the dimension of the sub-systems, hence, providing a criterion for sub-system selection. The assimilation procedure is carried out on the local error covariances with a distributed iterate collapse inversion (DICI) algorithm that we introduce. The DICI algorithm computes the (approximated) centralized Riccati and Lyapunov equations iteratively with only local communication and low-order computation. We fuse the observations that are common among the local Kalman filters using bipartite fusion graphs and consensus averaging algorithms. The proposed algorithm achieves full distribution of the Kalman filter that is coherent with the centralized Kalman filter with an $L$th order Gaussian-Markovian structure on the centralized error processes. Nowhere storage, communication, or computation of $n-$dimensional vectors and matrices is needed; only $n_l \\\\ll n$ dimensional vectors and matrices are communicated or used in the computation at the sensors.',\n",

The capacity region of the Finite-State Multiple Access Channel (FS-MAC) with feedback that may be an arbitrary time-invariant function of the channel output samples is considered. We characterize both an inner and an outer bound for this region, using Masseys's directed information. These bounds are shown to coincide, and hence yield the capacity region, of FS-MACs where the state process is stationary and ergodic and not affected by the inputs.   Though `multi-letter' in general, our results yield explicit conclusions when applied to specific scenarios of interest. E.g., our results allow us to:   - Identify a large class of FS-MACs, that includes the additive mod-2 noise MAC where the noise may have memory, for which feedback does not enlarge the capacity region.   - Deduce that, for a general FS-MAC with states that are not affected by the input, if the capacity (region) without feedback is zero, then so is the capacity (region) with feedback.   - Deduce that the capacity region of a MAC that can be decomposed into a `multiplexer' concatenated by a point-to-point channel (with, without, or with partial feedback), the capacity region is given by $\\\\sum_{m} R_m \\\\leq C$, where C is the capacity of the point to point channel and m indexes the encoders.

              " 'Diversity of MIMO Multihop Relay Channels.  We consider slow fading relay channels with a single multi-antenna source-destination terminal pair. The source signal arrives at the destination via N hops through N-1 layers of relays. We analyze the diversity of such channels with fixed network size at high SNR. In the clustered case where the relays within the same layer can have full cooperation, the cooperative decode-and-forward (DF) scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The upper bound on the DMT, the cut-set bound, is attained. In the non-clustered case, we show that the naive amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme has the maximum multiplexing gain of the channel but is suboptimal in diversity, as compared to the cut-set bound. To improve the diversity, space-time relay processing is introduced through the parallel partition of the multihop channel. The idea is to let the source signal go through K different \"AF paths\" in the multihop channel. This parallel AF scheme creates a parallel channel in the time domain and has the maximum diversity if the partition is properly designed. Since this scheme does not achieve the maximum multiplexing gain in general, we propose a flip-and-forward (FF) scheme that is built from the parallel AF scheme. It is shown that the FF scheme achieves both the maximum diversity and multiplexing gains in a distributed multihop channel of arbitrary size. In order to realize the DMT promised by the relaying strategies, approximately universal coding schemes are also proposed.',\n",

We start from the simple principle that model variables should, as much as possible, render the future and past conditionally independent. From this, we construct an objective function for model making whose extrema embody the trade-off between a model's structural complexity and its predictive power. The solutions correspond to a hierarchy of models that, at each level of complexity, achieve optimal predictive power at minimal cost. In the limit of maximal prediction the resulting optimal model identifies a process's intrinsic organization by extracting the underlying causal states. In this limit, the model's complexity is given by the statistical complexity, which is known to be minimal for achieving maximum prediction. Examples show how theory building can profit from analyzing a process's causal compressibility, which is reflected in the optimal models' rate-distortion curve--the process's characteristic for optimally balancing structure and noise at different levels of representation.\",\n",

The partition function pertaining to finite--temperature decoding of a (typical) randomly chosen code is known to have three types of behavior, corresponding to three phases in the plane of rate vs. temperature: the {\\\\it ferromagnetic phase}, corresponding to correct decoding, the {\\\\it paramagnetic phase}, of complete disorder, which is dominated by exponentially many incorrect codewords, and the {\\\\it glassy phase} (or the condensed phase), where the system is frozen at minimum energy and dominated by subexponentially many incorrect codewords. We show that the statistical physics associated with the two latter phases are intimately related to random coding exponents. In particular, the exponent associated with the probability of correct decoding at rates above capacity is directly related to the free energy in the glassy phase, and the exponent associated with probability of error (the error exponent) at rates below capacity, is strongly related to the free energy in the paramagnetic phase. In fact, we derive alternative expressions of these exponents in terms of the corresponding free energies, and make an attempt to obtain some insights from these expressions. Finally, as a side result, we also compare the phase diagram associated with a simple finite-temperature universal decoder for discrete memoryless channels, to that of the finite--temperature decoder that is aware of the channel statistics.',\n",

We show that the use of a noise shaping filter makes it possible to trade off central distortion for side distortion. Asymptotically as the dimension of the lattice vector quantizer and order of the noise shaping filter approach infinity, the entropy rate of the dithered Delta-Sigma quantization scheme approaches the symmetric two-channel MD rate-distortion function for a memoryless Gaussian source and MSE fidelity criterion, at any side-to-central distortion ratio and any resolution. In the optimal scheme, the infinite-order noise shaping filter must be minimum phase and have a piece-wise flat power spectrum with a single jump discontinuity.

The focused proof system of Andreoli for linear logic has been applied to both the proof search and the proof normalization approaches to computation. Various proof systems in literature exhibit characteristics of focusing to one degree or another. We present a new, focused proof system for intuitionistic logic, called LJF, and show how other proof systems can be mapped into the new system by inserting logical connectives that prematurely stop focusing. We also use LJF to design a focused proof system for classical logic. Our approach to the design and analysis of these systems is based on the completeness of focusing in linear logic and on the notion of polarity that appears in Girard's LC and LU proof systems.\",\n",
              " 'Capacity of the Degraded Half-Duplex Relay Channel.  A discrete memoryless half-duplex relay channel is constructed from a broadcast channel from the source to the relay and destination and a multiple access channel from the source and relay to the destination. When the relay listens, the channel operates in the broadcast mode. The channel switches to the multiple access mode when the relay transmits. If the broadcast component channel is physically degraded, the half-duplex relay channel will also be referred to as physically degraded. The capacity of this degraded half-duplex relay channel is examined. It is shown that the block Markov coding suggested in the seminal paper by Cover and El Gamal can be modified to achieve capacity for the degraded half-duplex relay channel. In the code construction, the listen-transmit schedule of the relay is made to depend on the message to be sent and hence the schedule carries information itself. If the schedule is restricted to be deterministic, it is shown that the capacity can be achieved by a simple management of information flows across the broadcast and multiple access component channels.',\n",
              " 'Benefiting from Disorder: Source Coding for Unordered Data.  The order of letters is not always relevant in a communication task. This paper discusses the implications of order irrelevance on source coding, presenting results in several major branches of source coding theory: lossless coding, universal lossless coding, rate-distortion, high-rate quantization, and universal lossy coding. The main conclusions demonstrate that there is a significant rate savings when order is irrelevant. In particular, lossless coding of n letters from a finite alphabet requires Theta(log n) bits and universal lossless coding requires n + o(n) bits for many countable alphabet sources. However, there are no universal schemes that can drive a strong redundancy measure to zero. Results for lossy coding include distribution-free expressions for the rate savings from order irrelevance in various high-rate quantization schemes. Rate-distortion bounds are given, and it is shown that the analogue of the Shannon lower bound is loose at all finite rates.',\n",

Solomonoff's central result on induction is that the posterior of a universal semimeasure M converges rapidly and with probability 1 to the true sequence generating posterior mu, if the latter is computable. Hence, M is eligible as a universal sequence predictor in case of unknown mu. Despite some nearby results and proofs in the literature, the stronger result of convergence for all (Martin-Loef) random sequences remained open. Such a convergence result would be particularly interesting and natural, since randomness can be defined in terms of M itself. We show that there are universal semimeasures M which do not converge for all random sequences, i.e. we give a partial negative answer to the open problem. We also provide a positive answer for some non-universal semimeasures. We define the incomputable measure D as a mixture over all computable measures and the enumerable semimeasure W as a mixture over all enumerable nearly-measures. We show that W converges to D and D to mu on all random sequences. The Hellinger distance measuring closeness of two distributions plays a central role.\",\n",

A perfect family of such codes is one in which each of the codes in the family is capacity-achieving. We show by construction that perfect rateless codes with low-complexity decoding algorithms exist for additive white Gaussian noise channels. Our construction involves the use of layered encoding and successive decoding, together with repetition using time-varying layer weights.

These authors considered the Euclidean plane and proved the existence and uniqueness of zone diagrams there. In the present paper we generalize this concept in various ways. We consider general sites in m-spaces (a simple generalization of metric spaces) and prove several existence and (non)uniqueness results in this setting. In contrast to previous works, our (rather simple) proofs are based on purely order theoretic arguments. Many explicit examples are given, and some of them illustrate new phenomena which occur in the general case.

The channel state information is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and the receiver. The parallel wire-tap channel with independent subchannels is first studied, which serves as an information-theoretic model for the fading wire-tap channel. The secrecy capacity of the parallel wire-tap channel is established.

We consider the `one-shot frame synchronization problem' where a decoder wants to locate a sync pattern at the output of a channel on the basis of sequential observations. We assume that the sync pattern of length N starts being emitted at a random time within some interval of size A, that characterizes the asynchronism level between the transmitter and the receiver. We show that a sequential decoder can optimally locate the sync pattern, i.e., exactly, without delay, and with probability approaching one as N tends to infinity, if and only if the asynchronism level grows as O(exp(N*k)), with k below the `synchronization threshold,' a constant that admits a simple expression depending on the channel. This constant is the same as the one that characterizes the limit for reliable asynchronous communication, as was recently reported by the authors. If k exceeds the synchronization threshold, any decoder, sequential or non-sequential, locates the sync pattern with an error that tends to one as N tends to infinity. Hence, a sequential decoder can locate a sync pattern as well as the (non-sequential) maximum likelihood decoder that operates on the basis of output sequences of maximum length A+N-1, but with much fewer observations.\",\n",

Space-time block codes (STBCs) that are single-symbol decodable (SSD) in a co-located multiple antenna setting need not be SSD in a distributed cooperative communication setting. A relay network with N relays and a single source-destination pair is called a partially-coherent relay channel (PCRC) if the destination has perfect channel state information (CSI) of all the channels and the relays have only the phase information of the source-to-relay channels. In this paper, first, a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a STBC to be SSD for co-located multiple antenna communication is obtained. Then, this is extended to a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a distributed STBC (DSTBC) to be SSD for a PCRC, by identifying the additional conditions. Using this, several SSD DSTBCs for PCRC are identified among the known classes of STBCs. It is proved that even if a SSD STBC for a co-located MIMO channel does not satisfy the additional conditions for the code to be SSD for a PCRC, single-symbol decoding of it in a PCRC gives full-diversity and only coding gain is lost. It is shown that when a DSTBC is SSD for a PCRC, then arbitrary coordinate interleaving of the in-phase and quadrature-phase components of the variables does not disturb its SSD property for PCRC. Finally, it is shown that the possibility of {\\\\em channel phase compensation} operation at the relay nodes using partial CSI at the relays increases the possible rate of SSD DSTBCs from $\\\\frac{2}{N}$ when the relays do not have CSI to 1/2, which is independent of N.',\n",

In this paper, we consider a more realistic model, where wireless networks are modeled by random geometric graphs with interference and noise. In this model, the capacities of links are not independent. We consider two scenarios, single source multiple destinations and multiple sources multiple destinations. In the first scenario, employing coupling and martingale methods, we show that the network coding capacity for random wireless networks still exhibits a concentration behavior around the mean value of the minimum cut under some mild conditions. Furthermore, we establish upper and lower bounds on the network coding capacity for dependent and independent nodes. In the second one, we also show that the network coding capacity still follows a concentration behavior. Our simulation results confirm our theoretical predictions.',\n",

In this paper, we revisit and extend the NP-complete decision procedure for a bounded number of sessions. We use a, now standard, deducibility constraints formalism for modeling security protocols. Our first contribution is to give a simple set of constraint simplification rules, that allows to reduce any deducibility constraint system to a set of solved forms, representing all solutions (within the bound on sessions).   As a consequence, we prove that deciding the existence of key cycles is NP-complete for a bounded number of sessions. The problem of key-cycles has been put forward by recent works relating computational and symbolic models. The so-called soundness of the symbolic model requires indeed that no key cycle (e.g., enc(k,k)) ever occurs in the execution of the protocol. Otherwise, stronger security assumptions (such as KDM-security) are required.   We show that our decision procedure can also be applied to prove again the decidability of authentication-like properties and the decidability of a significant fragment of protocols with timestamps.',\n",

The coarsest approximation of the structure of a complex network, such as the Internet, is a simple undirected unweighted graph. This approximation, however, loses too much detail. In reality, objects represented by vertices and edges in such a graph possess some non-trivial internal structure that varies across and differentiates among distinct types of links or nodes. In this work, we abstract such additional information as network annotations. We introduce a network topology modeling framework that treats annotations as an extended correlation profile of a network. Assuming we have this profile measured for a given network, we present an algorithm to rescale it in order to construct networks of varying size that still reproduce the original measured annotation profile.   Using this methodology, we accurately capture the network properties essential for realistic simulations of network applications and protocols, or any other simulations involving complex network topologies, including modeling and simulation of network evolution. We apply our approach to the Autonomous System (AS) topology of the Internet annotated with business relationships between ASs. This topology captures the large-scale structure of the Internet. In depth understanding of this structure and tools to model it are cornerstones of research on future Internet architectures and designs. We find that our techniques are able to accurately capture the structure of annotation correlations within this topology, thus reproducing a number of its important properties in synthetically-generated random graphs.',\n",

Unlike the case of maximum-likelihood decoding, in this case, even the perfect lattice space-time codes which have the non-vanishing determinant property can not achieve the optimal rate-diversity trade-off. Indeed, we show that in the case of naive lattice decoding, when we fix the underlying lattice, all the codes based on full-rate lattices have the same rate-diversity trade-off as V-BLAST. Also, we drive a lower bound on the symbol error probability of the naive lattice decoding for the fixed-rate MIMO systems (with equal numbers of receive and transmit antennas). This bound shows that asymptotically, the naive lattice decoding has an unbounded loss in terms of the required SNR, compared to the maximum likelihood decoding.',\n",

Let X_1,...., X_n be a collection of iid discrete random variables, and Y_1,..., Y_m a set of noisy observations of such variables.

We establish a general relation between the distribution of \\\\mu_i, and the fixed points of the associated density evolution operator. Such relation holds asymptotically in the large system limit, provided the average number of variables an observation depends on is bounded. We discuss the relevance of our result to a number of applications, ranging from sparse graph codes, to multi-user detection, to group testing.\",\n",

Let shift$(G,\\\\delta)$ denote the minimum number of vertices that need to be moved to untangle $\\\\delta$. We show that shift$(G,\\\\delta)$ is NP-hard to compute and to approximate. Our hardness results extend to a version of \\\\textsc{1BendPointSetEmbeddability}, a well-known graph-drawing problem.

              " 'Brief encounter networks.  Many complex human and natural phenomena can usefully be represented as networks describing the relationships between individuals. While these relationships are typically intermittent, previous research has used network representations that aggregate the relationships at discrete intervals. However, such an aggregation discards important temporal information, thus inhibiting our understanding of the networks dynamic behaviour and evolution. We have recorded patterns of human urban encounter using Bluetooth technology thus retaining the temporal properties of this network. Here we show how this temporal information influences the structural properties of the network. We show that the temporal properties of human urban encounter are scale-free, leading to an overwhelming proportion of brief encounters between individuals. While previous research has shown preferential attachment to result in scale-free connectivity in aggregated network data, we found that scale-free connectivity results from the temporal properties of the network. In addition, we show that brief encounters act as weak social ties in the diffusion of non-expiring information, yet persistent encounters provide the means for sustaining time-expiring information through a network.',\n",

On the practical side, simple protocols for Rabin Oblivious Transfer, 1-2 Oblivious Transfer and Bit Commitment are presented. No quantum memory is required for honest players, whereas the protocols can only be broken by an adversary controlling a large amount of quantum memory. The protocols are efficient, non-interactive and can be implemented with today's technology.   On the theoretical side, new entropic uncertainty relations involving min-entropy are established and used to prove the security of protocols according to new strong security definitions. For instance, in the realistic setting of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) against quantum-memory-bounded eavesdroppers, the uncertainty relation allows to prove the security of QKD protocols while tolerating considerably higher error rates compared to the standard model with unbounded adversaries.\",\n",

In particular, we give a new, simulation-based, definition for security in the bounded-quantum-storage model, and show that this definition allows for sequential composition of protocols. Damgard et al. (FOCS '05, CRYPTO '07) showed how to securely implement bit commitment and oblivious transfer in the bounded-quantum-storage model, where the adversary is only allowed to store a limited number of qubits. However, their security definitions did only apply to the standalone setting, and it was not clear if their protocols could be composed. Indeed, we first give a simple attack that shows that these protocols are not composable without a small refinement of the model. Finally, we prove the security of their randomized oblivious transfer protocol in our refined model. Secure implementations of oblivious transfer and bit commitment then follow easily by a (classical) reduction to randomized oblivious transfer.\",\n",

It has been shown that for a graph to be navigable, its construction needs to meet strict criteria. Since such graphs nevertheless seem to appear in nature, it is of interest to understand why these criteria should be fulfilled.   In this paper we present a simple method for constructing graphs based on a model where nodes vertices are ``similar'' in two different ways, and tend to connect to those most similar to them - or cluster - with respect to both. We prove that this leads to navigable networks for several cases, and hypothesize that it also holds in great generality. Enough generality, perhaps, to explain the occurrence of navigable networks in nature.\",\n",
              " 'Competition in Wireless Systems via Bayesian Interference Games.  We study competition between wireless devices with incomplete information about their opponents. We model such interactions as Bayesian interference games. Each wireless device selects a power profile over the entire available bandwidth to maximize its data rate. Such competitive models represent situations in which several wireless devices share spectrum without any central authority or coordinated protocol.   In contrast to games where devices have complete information about their opponents, we consider scenarios where the devices are unaware of the interference they cause to other devices. Such games, which are modeled as Bayesian games, can exhibit significantly different equilibria. We first consider a simple scenario of simultaneous move games, where we show that the unique Bayes-Nash equilibrium is where both devices spread their power equally across the entire bandwidth. We then extend this model to a two-tiered spectrum sharing case where users act sequentially. Here one of the devices, called the primary user, is the owner of the spectrum and it selects its power profile first. The second device (called the secondary user) then responds by choosing a power profile to maximize its Shannon capacity. In such sequential move games, we show that there exist equilibria in which the primary user obtains a higher data rate by using only a part of the bandwidth.   In a repeated Bayesian interference game, we show the existence of reputation effects: an informed primary user can bluff to prevent spectrum usage by a secondary user who suffers from lack of information about the channel gains. The resulting equilibrium can be highly inefficient, suggesting that competitive spectrum sharing is highly suboptimal.',\n",

Discovering the 'Neural Code' from multi-neuronal spike trains is an important task in neuroscience. For such an analysis, it is important to unearth interesting regularities in the spiking patterns. In this report, we present an efficient method for automatically discovering synchrony, synfire chains, and more general sequences of neuronal firings. We use the Frequent Episode Discovery framework of Laxman, Sastry, and Unnikrishnan (2005), in which the episodes are represented and recognized using finite-state automata. Many aspects of functional connectivity between neuronal populations can be inferred from the episodes. We demonstrate these using simulated multi-neuronal data from a Poisson model. We also present a method to assess the statistical significance of the discovered episodes. Since the Temporal Data Mining (TDM) methods used in this report can analyze data from hundreds and potentially thousands of neurons, we argue that this framework is appropriate for discovering the `Neural Code'.\",\n",

This paper is focused on the derivation of some universal properties of capacity-approaching low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensembles whose transmission takes place over memoryless binary-input output-symmetric (MBIOS) channels. Properties of the degree distributions, graphical complexity and the number of fundamental cycles in the bipartite graphs are considered via the derivation of information-theoretic bounds. These bounds are expressed in terms of the target block/ bit error probability and the gap (in rate) to capacity. Most of the bounds are general for any decoding algorithm, and some others are proved under belief propagation (BP) decoding. Proving these bounds under a certain decoding algorithm, validates them automatically also under any sub-optimal decoding algorithm. A proper modification of these bounds makes them universal for the set of all MBIOS channels which exhibit a given capacity. Bounds on the degree distributions and graphical complexity apply to finite-length LDPC codes and to the asymptotic case of an infinite block length. The bounds are compared with capacity-approaching LDPC code ensembles under BP decoding, and they are shown to be informative and are easy to calculate. Finally, some interesting open problems are considered.',\n",

I postulate that human or other intelligent agents function or should function as follows. They store all sensory observations as they come - the data is holy. At any time, given some agent\\'s current coding capabilities, part of the data is compressible by a short and hopefully fast program / description / explanation / world model. In the agent\\'s subjective eyes, such data is more regular and more \"beautiful\" than other data. It is well-known that knowledge of regularity and repeatability may improve the agent\\'s ability to plan actions leading to external rewards. In absence of such rewards, however, known beauty is boring. Then \"interestingness\" becomes the first derivative of subjective beauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly apparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful. Such progress in compressibility is measured and maximized by the curiosity drive: create action sequences that extend the observation history and yield previously unknown / unpredictable but quickly learnable algorithmic regularity. We discuss how all of the above can be naturally implemented on computers, through an extension of passive unsupervised learning to the case of active data selection: we reward a general reinforcement learner (with access to the adaptive compressor) for actions that improve the subjective compressibility of the growing data. An unusually large breakthrough in compressibility deserves the name \"discovery\". The \"creativity\" of artists, dancers, musicians, pure mathematicians can be viewed as a by-product of this principle. Several qualitative examples support this hypothesis.',\n",

Constant dimension codes are equivalent to the so-called linear authentication codes introduced by Wang, Xing and Safavi-Naini when constructing distributed authentication systems in 2003. In this paper, we study constant dimension codes. It is shown that Steiner structures are optimal constant dimension codes achieving the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound. Furthermore, we show that constant dimension codes achieve the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound if and only if they are certain Steiner structures. Then, we derive two Johnson type upper bounds, say I and II, on constant dimension codes. The Johnson type bound II slightly improves on the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound. Finally, we point out that a family of known Steiner structures is actually a family of optimal constant dimension codes achieving both the Johnson type bounds I and II.',\n",

As multicore systems continue to gain ground in the High Performance Computing world, linear algebra algorithms have to be reformulated or new algorithms have to be developed in order to take advantage of the architectural features on these new processors. Fine grain parallelism becomes a major requirement and introduces the necessity of loose synchronization in the parallel execution of an operation. This paper presents an algorithm for the Cholesky, LU and QR factorization where the operations can be represented as a sequence of small tasks that operate on square blocks of data. These tasks can be dynamically scheduled for execution based on the dependencies among them and on the availability of computational resources. This may result in an out of order execution of the tasks which will completely hide the presence of intrinsically sequential tasks in the factorization.

It shows that classical logic, both syntactically and semantically, is just a special, conservative fragment of this more general and, in a sense, more basic logic -- the logic of resources in the form of cirquent calculus. The reader will find various arguments in favor of switching to the new framework, such as arguments showing the insufficiency of the expressive power of linear logic or other formula-based approaches to developing resource logics, exponential improvements over the traditional approaches in both representational and proof complexities offered by cirquent calculus, and more.

Rank-width is an equivalent complexity measure for undirected graphs and has good algorithmic and structural properties. It is in particular related to the vertex-minor relation. We discuss an extension of the notion of rank-width to edge-colored graphs. A C-colored graph is a graph where the arcs are colored with colors from the set C. There is not a natural notion of rank-width for C-colored graphs. We define two notions of rank-width for them, both based on a coding of C-colored graphs by edge-colored graphs where each edge has exactly one color from a field F and named respectively F-rank-width and F-bi-rank-width. The two notions are equivalent to clique-width. We then present a notion of vertex-minor for F-colored graphs and prove that F-colored graphs of bounded F-rank-width are characterised by a finite list of F-colored graphs to exclude as vertex-minors. A cubic-time algorithm to decide whether a F-colored graph has F-rank-width (resp. F-bi-rank-width) at most k, for fixed k, is also given. Graph operations to check MSOL-definable properties on F-colored graphs of bounded rank-width are presented.

Bregman divergences include not only the traditional (squared) Euclidean distance but also various divergence measures based on entropic functions. Accordingly, Bregman Voronoi diagrams allow to define information-theoretic Voronoi diagrams in statistical parametric spaces based on the relative entropy of distributions. We define several types of Bregman diagrams, establish correspondences between those diagrams (using the Legendre transformation), and show how to compute them efficiently. We also introduce extensions of these diagrams, e.g. k-order and k-bag Bregman Voronoi diagrams, and introduce Bregman triangulations of a set of points and their connexion with Bregman Voronoi diagrams. We show that these triangulations capture many of the properties of the celebrated Delaunay triangulation.

We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the proposed system to reach a consensus on globally optimal decision statistics. One of the major results proved in this work is that a consensus is reached with exponential convergence speed for any bounded delay condition if and only if the directed graph is quasi-strongly connected. We provide a closed form expression for the global consensus, showing that the effect of delays is, in general, the introduction of a bias in the final decision.

Recently Li and Xia have proposed a transmission scheme for wireless relay networks based on the Alamouti space time code and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing to combat the effect of timing errors at the relay nodes. This transmission scheme is amazingly simple and achieves a diversity order of two for any number of relays. Motivated by its simplicity, this scheme is extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity for any number of relays. The conditions on the distributed space time code (DSTC) structure that admit its application in the proposed transmission scheme are identified and it is pointed out that the recently proposed full diversity four group decodable DSTCs from precoded co-ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs and extended Clifford algebras satisfy these conditions. It is then shown how differential encoding at the source can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme to arrive at a new transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity in asynchronous wireless relay networks with no channel information and also no timing error knowledge at the destination node. Finally, four group decodable distributed differential space time codes applicable in this new transmission scheme for power of two number of relays are also provided.',\n",

              " 'Geographic Gossip: Efficient Averaging for Sensor Networks.  Gossip algorithms for distributed computation are attractive due to their simplicity, distributed nature, and robustness in noisy and uncertain environments. However, using standard gossip algorithms can lead to a significant waste in energy by repeatedly recirculating redundant information. For realistic sensor network model topologies like grids and random geometric graphs, the inefficiency of gossip schemes is related to the slow mixing times of random walks on the communication graph. We propose and analyze an alternative gossiping scheme that exploits geographic information. By utilizing geographic routing combined with a simple resampling method, we demonstrate substantial gains over previously proposed gossip protocols. For regular graphs such as the ring or grid, our algorithm improves standard gossip by factors of $n$ and $\\\\sqrt{n}$ respectively. For the more challenging case of random geometric graphs, our algorithm computes the true average to accuracy $\\\\epsilon$ using $O(\\\\frac{n^{1.5}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}} \\\\log \\\\epsilon^{-1})$ radio transmissions, which yields a $\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n}{\\\\log n}}$ factor improvement over standard gossip algorithms.

We describe a correspondence between xyz graphs and face-colored embeddings of the graph onto two-dimensional manifolds, and we relate bipartiteness of the xyz graph to orientability of the underlying topological surface. Using this correspondence, we show that planar graphs are xyz graphs if and only if they are bipartite, cubic, and three-connected, and that it is NP-complete to determine whether an arbitrary graph is an xyz graph.

The downlink transmission in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has been extensively studied from both communication-theoretic and information-theoretic perspectives. Most of these papers assume perfect/imperfect channel knowledge. In general, the problem of channel training and estimation is studied separately. However, in interference-limited communication systems with high mobility, this problem is tightly coupled with the problem of maximizing throughput of the system. In this paper, scheduling and pre-conditioning based schemes in the presence of reciprocal channel are considered to address this. In the case of homogeneous users, a scheduling scheme is proposed and an improved lower bound on the sum capacity is derived. The problem of choosing training sequence length to maximize net throughput of the system is studied. In the case of heterogeneous users, a modified pre-conditioning method is proposed and an optimized pre-conditioning matrix is derived. This method is combined with a scheduling scheme to further improve net achievable weighted-sum rate.',\n",

In wireless data networks, communication is particularly susceptible to eavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. Security and privacy systems have become critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper considers the problem of secret communication over the Gaussian broadcast channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential messages to two users with information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each user would like to obtain its own confidential message in a reliable and safe manner. This communication model is referred to as the multi-antenna Gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages (MGBC-CM). Under this communication scenario, a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and the corresponding achievable secrecy rate region are first developed based on Gaussian codebooks. Next, a computable Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy capacity region is provided for the MGBC-CM. Furthermore, the Sato-type outer bound prove to be consistent with the boundary of the secret dirty-paper coding achievable rate region, and hence, the secrecy capacity region of the MGBC-CM is established. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate that both users can achieve positive rates simultaneously under the information-theoretic secrecy requirement.',\n",
              " \"Lagrangian Relaxation for MAP Estimation in Graphical Models.  We develop a general framework for MAP estimation in discrete and Gaussian graphical models using Lagrangian relaxation techniques. The key idea is to reformulate an intractable estimation problem as one defined on a more tractable graph, but subject to additional constraints. Relaxing these constraints gives a tractable dual problem, one defined by a thin graph, which is then optimized by an iterative procedure. When this iterative optimization leads to a consistent estimate, one which also satisfies the constraints, then it corresponds to an optimal MAP estimate of the original model. Otherwise there is a ``duality gap'', and we obtain a bound on the optimal solution. Thus, our approach combines convex optimization with dynamic programming techniques applicable for thin graphs. The popular tree-reweighted max-product (TRMP) method may be seen as solving a particular class of such relaxations, where the intractable graph is relaxed to a set of spanning trees. We also consider relaxations to a set of small induced subgraphs, thin subgraphs (e.g. loops), and a connected tree obtained by ``unwinding'' cycles. In addition, we propose a new class of multiscale relaxations that introduce ``summary'' variables. The potential benefits of such generalizations include: reducing or eliminating the ``duality gap'' in hard problems, reducing the number or Lagrange multipliers in the dual problem, and accelerating convergence of the iterative optimization procedure.\",\n",

              " \"Distributed MIMO receiver - Achievable rates and upper bounds.  In this paper we investigate the achievable rate of a system that includes a nomadic transmitter with several antennas, which is received by multiple agents, exhibiting independent channel gains and additive circular-symmetric complex Gaussian noise. In the nomadic regime, we assume that the agents do not have any decoding ability. These agents process their channel observations and forward them to the final destination through lossless links with a fixed capacity. We propose new achievable rates based on elementary compression and also on a Wyner-Ziv (CEO-like) processing, for both fast fading and block fading channels, as well as for general discrete channels. The simpler two agents scheme is solved, up to an implicit equation with a single variable. Limiting the nomadic transmitter to a circular-symmetric complex Gaussian signalling, new upper bounds are derived for both fast and block fading, based on the vector version of the entropy power inequality. These bounds are then compared to the achievable rates in several extreme scenarios. The asymptotic setting with numbers of agents and transmitter's antennas taken to infinity is analyzed. In addition, the upper bounds are analytically shown to be tight in several examples, while numerical calculations reveal a rather small gap in a finite $2\\\\times2$ setting. The advantage of the Wyner-Ziv approach over elementary compression is shown where only the former can achieve the full diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. We also consider the non-nomadic setting, with agents that can decode. Here we give an achievable rate, over fast fading channel, which combines broadcast with dirty paper coding and the decentralized reception, which was introduced for the nomadic setting.\",\n",

This paper investigates point-to-point information transmission over a wideband slow-fading channel, modeled as an (asymptotically) large number of independent identically distributed parallel channels, with the random channel fading realizations remaining constant over the entire coding block. On the one hand, in the wideband limit the minimum achievable energy per nat required for reliable transmission, as a random variable, converges in probability to certain deterministic quantity. On the other hand, the exponential decay rate of the outage probability, termed as the wideband outage exponent, characterizes how the number of parallel channels, {\\\\it i.e.}, the ``bandwidth'', should asymptotically scale in order to achieve a targeted outage probability at a targeted energy per nat. We examine two scenarios: when the transmitter has no channel state information and adopts uniform transmit power allocation among parallel channels; and when the transmitter is endowed with an one-bit channel state feedback for each parallel channel and accordingly allocates its transmit power. For both scenarios, we evaluate the wideband minimum energy per nat and the wideband outage exponent, and discuss their implication for system performance.\",\n",

We investigate the following question: if a polynomial can be evaluated at rational points by a polynomial-time boolean algorithm, does it have a polynomial-size arithmetic circuit?

Answering it negatively would indeed imply that the constant-free versions of the algebraic complexity classes VP and VNP defined by Valiant are different. Answering this question positively would imply a transfer theorem from boolean to algebraic complexity. Our proof method relies on Lagrange interpolation and on recent results connecting the (boolean) counting hierarchy to algebraic complexity classes. As a byproduct we obtain two additional results: (i) The constant-free, degree-unbounded version of Valiant's hypothesis that VP and VNP differ implies the degree-bounded version. This result was previously known to hold for fields of positive characteristic only. (ii) If exponential sums of easy to compute polynomials can be computed efficiently, then the same is true of exponential products.

The elucidation upon fly's neuronal patterns as a link to computer graphics and memory cards I/O's, is investigated for the phenomenon by propounding a unified theory of Einstein's two known relativities. It is conclusive that flies could contribute a certain amount of neuromatrices indicating an imagery function of a visual-computational system into computer graphics and storage systems. The visual system involves the time aspect, whereas flies possess faster pulses compared to humans' visual ability due to the E-field state on an active fly's eye surface. This behaviour can be tested on a dissected fly specimen at its ommatidia. Electro-optical contacts and electrodes are wired through the flesh forming organic emitter layer to stimulate light emission, thereby to a computer circuit. The next step is applying a threshold voltage with secondary voltages to the circuit denoting an array of essential electrodes for bit switch. As a result, circuit's dormant pulses versus active pulses at the specimen's area are recorded. The outcome matrix possesses a construction of RGB and time radicals expressing the time problem in consumption, allocating time into computational algorithms, enhancing the technology far beyond. The obtained formulation generates consumed distance cons(x), denoting circuital travel between data source/sink for pixel data and bendable wavelengths.

With some control on the different involved sizes it is then possible to perform some of the $q$-adic arithmetic directly with machine integers or floating points. Depending also on the number of performed numerical operations one can then convert back to the $q$-adic or $X$-adic representation and eventually mod out high residues. In this note we present a new version of both conversions: more tabulations and a way to reduce the number of divisions involved in the process are presented.

A model is considered in which the feed-forward and feedback signals share the same noisy channel. More specifically, a discrete memoryless modulo-additive channel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is shown that a judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity to the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the wiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a private key, known only to the destination. Then a half-duplex system is considered, for which a novel feedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even when the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination channel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of the channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over the channel without revealing its key to the source.',\n",

Acquiring feedback from many users allows multi-user diversity to be exploited, while high-rate feedback allows for very precise selection of beamforming directions. It is shown that systems in which a limited number of users feedback high-rate channel information significantly outperform low-rate/many user systems.

This paper establishes the equivalence between cognitive medium access and the competitive multi-armed bandit problem. First, the scenario in which a single cognitive user wishes to opportunistically exploit the availability of empty frequency bands in the spectrum with multiple bands is considered. In this scenario, the availability probability of each channel is unknown to the cognitive user a priori. Hence efficient medium access strategies must strike a balance between exploring the availability of other free channels and exploiting the opportunities identified thus far. By adopting a Bayesian approach for this classical bandit problem, the optimal medium access strategy is derived and its underlying recursive structure is illustrated via examples. To avoid the prohibitive computational complexity of the optimal strategy, a low complexity asymptotically optimal strategy is developed. The proposed strategy does not require any prior statistical knowledge about the traffic pattern on the different channels. Next, the multi-cognitive user scenario is considered and low complexity medium access protocols, which strike the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation in such competitive environments, are developed. Finally, this formalism is extended to the case in which each cognitive user is capable of sensing and using multiple channels simultaneously.',\n",

              " 'Heap Reference Analysis for Functional Programs.  Current garbage collectors leave a lot of garbage uncollected because they conservatively approximate liveness by reachability from program variables. In this paper, we describe a sequence of static analyses that takes as input a program written in a first-order, eager functional programming language, and finds at each program point the references to objects that are guaranteed not to be used in the future. Such references are made null by a transformation pass. If this makes the object unreachable, it can be collected by the garbage collector. This causes more garbage to be collected, resulting in fewer collections. Additionally, for those garbage collectors which scavenge live objects, it makes each collection faster.   The interesting aspects of our method are both in the identification of the analyses required to solve the problem and the way they are carried out. We identify three different analyses -- liveness, sharing and accessibility. In liveness and sharing analyses, the function definitions are analyzed independently of the calling context. This is achieved by using a variable to represent the unknown context of the function being analyzed and setting up constraints expressing the effect of the function with respect to the variable. The solution of the constraints is a summary of the function that is parameterized with respect to a calling context and is used to analyze function calls. As a result we achieve context sensitivity at call sites without analyzing the function multiple number of times.',\n",

A local algorithm is a distributed algorithm where each node must operate solely based on the information that was available at system startup within a constant-size neighbourhood of the node. We study the applicability of local algorithms to max-min LPs where the objective is to maximise $\\\\min_k \\\\sum_v c_{kv} x_v$ subject to $\\\\sum_v a_{iv} x_v \\\\le 1$ for each $i$ and $x_v \\\\ge 0$ for each $v$. Here $c_{kv} \\\\ge 0$, $a_{iv} \\\\ge 0$, and the support sets $V_i = \\\\{v : a_{iv} > 0 \\\\}$, $V_k = \\\\{v : c_{kv}>0 \\\\}$, $I_v = \\\\{i : a_{iv} > 0 \\\\}$ and $K_v = \\\\{k : c_{kv} > 0 \\\\}$ have bounded size. In the distributed setting, each agent $v$ is responsible for choosing the value of $x_v$, and the communication network is a hypergraph $\\\\mathcal{H}$ where the sets $V_k$ and $V_i$ constitute the hyperedges. We present inapproximability results for a wide range of structural assumptions; for example, even if $|V_i|$ and $|V_k|$ are bounded by some constants larger than 2, there is no local approximation scheme. To contrast the negative results, we present a local approximation algorithm which achieves good approximation ratios if we can bound the relative growth of the vertex neighbourhoods in $\\\\mathcal{H}$.',\n",
              " 'Throughput Scaling in Random Wireless Networks: A Non-Hierarchical   Multipath Routing Strategy.  Franceschetti et al. have recently shown that per-node throughput in an extended, ad hoc wireless network with $\\\\Theta(n)$ randomly distributed nodes and multihop routing can be increased from the $\\\\Omega({1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\log n})$ scaling demonstrated in the seminal paper of Gupta and Kumar to $\\\\Omega({1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{n}})$. The goal of the present paper is to understand the dependence of this interesting result on the principal new features it introduced relative to Gupta-Kumar: (1) a capacity-based formula for link transmission bit-rates in terms of received signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR); (2) hierarchical routing from sources to destinations through a system of communal highways; and (3) cell-based routes constructed by percolation. The conclusion of the present paper is that the improved throughput scaling is principally due to the percolation-based routing, which enables shorter hops and, consequently, less interference. This is established by showing that throughput $\\\\Omega({1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{n}})$ can be attained by a system that does not employ highways, but instead uses percolation to establish, for each source-destination pair, a set of $\\\\Theta(\\\\log n)$ routes within a narrow routing corridor running from source to destination. As a result, highways are not essential. In addition, it is shown that throughput $\\\\Omega({1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{n}})$ can be attained with the original threshold transmission bit-rate model, provided that node transmission powers are permitted to grow with $n$. Thus, the benefit of the capacity bit-rate model is simply to permit the power to remain bounded, even as the network expands.',\n",

We answer this question in the affirmative with \\\\epsilon=1/4. The previous best known bound was \\\\Omega((\\\\log n / \\\\log\\\\log n)^{1/2}). We also consider untangling geometric trees.

We answer a question of Spillner and Wolff [arXiv:0709.0170 2007] by closing this gap for untangling trees. In particular, we show that for infinitely many values of n, there is an n-vertex geometric tree that cannot be untangled while keeping more than 3(n^{1/2}-1) vertices fixed. Moreover, we improve the lower bound to (n/2)^{1/2}.',\n",

In this paper, we first propose a novel common subexpression elimination (CSE) algorithm for matrix-vector multiplications over characteristic-2 fields. As opposed to previously proposed CSE algorithms, which usually focus on complexity savings due to recurrences of subexpressions, our CSE algorithm achieves two types of complexity reductions, differential savings and recurrence savings, by taking advantage of the cancelation property of characteristic-2 fields. Using our CSE algorithm, we reduce the additive complexities of cyclotomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs). Using a weighted sum of the numbers of multiplications and additions as a metric, our CFFTs achieve smaller total complexities than previously proposed CFFTs and other FFTs, requiring both fewer multiplications and fewer additions in many cases.',\n",

              " 'Cognitive Interference Channels with Confidential Messages.  The cognitive interference channel with confidential messages is studied. Similarly to the classical two-user interference channel, the cognitive interference channel consists of two transmitters whose signals interfere at the two receivers. It is assumed that there is a common message source (message 1) known to both transmitters, and an additional independent message source (message 2) known only to the cognitive transmitter (transmitter 2). The cognitive receiver (receiver 2) needs to decode both messages, while the non-cognitive receiver (receiver 1) should decode only the common message. Furthermore, message 2 is assumed to be a confidential message which needs to be kept as secret as possible from receiver 1, which is viewed as an eavesdropper with regard to message 2. The level of secrecy is measured by the equivocation rate. A single-letter expression for the capacity-equivocation region of the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel is established and is further explicitly derived for the Gaussian case. Moreover, particularizing the capacity-equivocation region to the case without a secrecy constraint, establishes a new capacity theorem for a class of interference channels, by providing a converse theorem.',\n",

Although the recognition of isolated handwritten digits has been a research topic for many years, it continues to be of interest for the research community and for commercial applications. We show that despite the maturity of the field, different approaches still deliver results that vary enough to allow improvements by using their combination. We do so by choosing four well-motivated state-of-the-art recognition systems for which results on the standard MNIST benchmark are available. When comparing the errors made, we observe that the errors made differ between all four systems, suggesting the use of classifier combination. We then determine the error rate of a hypothetical system that combines the output of the four systems. The result obtained in this manner is an error rate of 0.35% on the MNIST data, the best result published so far. We furthermore discuss the statistical significance of the combined result and of the results of the individual classifiers.',\n",

In this work we explore the process of deleting vertices of a $\\\\beta$-expander independently at random with probability $n^{-\\\\alpha}$ for some constant $\\\\alpha>0$, and study the properties of the resulting graph. Our main result states that as $n$ tends to infinity, the deletion process performed on a $\\\\beta$-expander graph of bounded degree will result with high probability in a graph composed of a giant component containing $n-o(n)$ vertices that is in itself an expander graph, and constant size components. We proceed by applying the main result to expander graphs with a positive spectral gap. In the particular case of $(n,d,\\\\lambda)$-graphs, that are such expanders, we compute the values of $\\\\alpha$, under additional constraints on the graph, for which with high probability the resulting graph will stay connected, or will be composed of a giant component and isolated vertices. As a graph sampled from the uniform probability space of $d$-regular graphs with high probability is an expander and meets the additional constraints, this result strengthens a recent result due to Greenhill, Holt and Wormald about vertex percolation on random $d$-regular graphs. We conclude by showing that performing the above described deletion process on graphs that expand sub-linear sets by an unbounded expansion ratio, with high probability results in a connected expander graph.',\n",

A linear mesh network is considered in which a single user per cell communicates to a local base station via a dedicated relay (two-hop communication). Exploiting the possibly relevant inter-cell channel gains, rate splitting with successive cancellation in both hops is investigated as a promising solution to improve the rate of basic single-rate communications. Then, an alternative solution is proposed that attempts to improve the performance of the second hop (from the relays to base stations) by cooperative transmission among the relay stations. The cooperative scheme leverages the common information obtained by the relays as a by-product of the use of rate splitting in the first hop. Numerical results bring insight into the conditions (network topology and power constraints) under which rate splitting, with possible relay cooperation, is beneficial. Multi-cell processing (joint decoding at the base stations) is also considered for reference.',\n",

Holographic reduced representations (HRR) are based on superpositions of convolution-bound $n$-tuples, but the $n$-tuples cannot be regarded as vectors since the formalism is basis dependent. This is why HRR cannot be associated with geometric structures. Replacing convolutions by geometric products one arrives at reduced representations analogous to HRR but interpretable in terms of geometry. Variable bindings occurring in both HRR and its geometric analogue mathematically correspond to two different representations of $Z_2\\\\times...\\\\times Z_2$ (the additive group of binary $n$-tuples with addition modulo 2). As opposed to standard HRR, variable binding performed by means of geometric product allows for computing exact inverses of all nonzero vectors, a procedure even simpler than approximate inverses employed in HRR. The formal structure of the new reduced representation is analogous to cartoon computation, a geometric analogue of quantum computation.',\n",

This work adopts an information theoretic framework for the design of collusion-resistant coding/decoding schemes for digital fingerprinting. More specifically, the minimum distance decision rule is used to identify 1 out of t pirates. Achievable rates, under this detection rule, are characterized in two distinct scenarios. First, we consider the averaging attack where a random coding argument is used to show that the rate 1/2 is achievable with t=2 pirates. Our study is then extended to the general case of arbitrary $t$ highlighting the underlying complexity-performance tradeoff. Overall, these results establish the significant performance gains offered by minimum distance decoding as compared to other approaches based on orthogonal codes and correlation detectors. In the second scenario, we characterize the achievable rates, with minimum distance decoding, under any collusion attack that satisfies the marking assumption. For t=2 pirates, we show that the rate $1-H(0.25)\\\\approx 0.188$ is achievable using an ensemble of random linear codes. For $t\\\\geq 3$, the existence of a non-resolvable collusion attack, with minimum distance decoding, for any non-zero rate is established. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we then construct coding/decoding schemes for fingerprinting based on the celebrated Belief-Propagation framework. Using an explicit repeat-accumulate code, we obtain a vanishingly small probability of misidentification at rate 1/3 under averaging attack with t=2. For collusion attacks which satisfy the marking assumption, we use a more sophisticated accumulate repeat accumulate code to obtain a vanishingly small misidentification probability at rate 1/9 with t=2. These results represent a marked improvement over the best available designs in the literature.',\n",

The reduction guarantees an average pairwise misranking regret of at most that of the binary classifier regret, improving a recent result of Balcan et al which only guarantees a factor of 2. Moreover, our reduction applies to a broader class of ranking loss functions, admits a simpler proof, and the expected running time complexity of our algorithm in terms of number of calls to a classifier or preference function is improved from $\\\\Omega(n^2)$ to $O(n \\\\log n)$. In addition, when the top $k$ ranked elements only are required ($k \\\\ll n$), as in many applications in information extraction or search engines, the time complexity of our algorithm can be further reduced to $O(k \\\\log k + n)$.

An efficient method is introduced in this paper to find the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components of time series data.

The approach is to transforms the original data function into a piecewise linear sawtooth function (or triangle wave function), then directly constructs the upper envelope by connecting the maxima and construct lower envelope by connecting minima with straight line segments in the sawtooth space, the IMF is calculated as the difference between the sawtooth function and the mean of the upper and lower envelopes. The results found in the sawtooth space are reversely transformed into the original data space as the required IMF and envelopes mean.

The problem of channel shortening equalization for optimal detection in ISI channels is considered. The problem is to choose a linear equalizer and a partial response target filter such that the combination produces the best detection performance. Instead of using the traditional approach of MMSE equalization, we directly seek all equalizer and target pairs that yield optimal detection performance in terms of the sequence or symbol error rate. This leads to a new notion of a posteriori equivalence between the equalized and target channels with a simple characterization in terms of their underlying probability distributions. Using this characterization we show the surprising existence an infinite family of equalizer and target pairs for which any maximum a posteriori (MAP) based detector designed for the target channel is simultaneously MAP optimal for the equalized channel. For channels whose input symbols have equal energy, such as q-PSK, the MMSE equalizer designed with a monic target constraint yields a solution belonging to this optimal family of designs. Although, these designs produce IIR target filters, the ideas are extended to design good FIR targets. For an arbitrary choice of target and equalizer, we derive an expression for the probability of sequence detection error. This expression is used to design optimal FIR targets and IIR equalizers and to quantify the FIR approximation penalty.',\n",

To address the situation we suggest to use self-organization processes of prime integer relations for information processing. Self-organization processes of prime integer relations define correlation structures of a complex system and can be equivalently represented by transformations of two-dimensional geometrical patterns determining the dynamics of the system and revealing its structural complexity. Computational experiments raise the possibility of an optimality condition of complex systems presenting the structural complexity of a system as a key to its optimization.   From this perspective the optimization of a system could be all about the control of the structural complexity of the system to make it consistent with the structural complexity of the problem. The experiments also indicate that the performance of a complex system may behave as a concave function of the structural complexity. Therefore, once the structural complexity could be controlled as a single entity, the optimization of a complex system would be potentially reduced to a one-dimensional concave optimization irrespective of the number of variables involved its description. This might open a way to a new type of information processing for efficient management of complex systems.',\n",

              " 'Analysis of a Mixed Strategy for Multiple Relay Networks.  In their landmark paper Cover and El Gamal proposed different coding strategies for the relay channel with a single relay supporting a communication pair. These strategies are the decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward approach, as well as a general lower bound on the capacity of a relay network which relies on the mixed application of the previous two strategies. So far, only parts of their work - the decode-and-forward and the compress-and-forward strategy - have been applied to networks with multiple relays.   This paper derives a mixed strategy for multiple relay networks using a combined approach of partial decode-and-forward with N +1 levels and the ideas of successive refinement with different side information at the receivers. After describing the protocol structure, we present the achievable rates for the discrete memoryless relay channel as well as Gaussian multiple relay networks. Using these results we compare the mixed strategy with some special cases, e. g., multilevel decode-and-forward, distributed compress-and-forward and a mixed approach where one relay node operates in decode-and-forward and the other in compress-and-forward mode.',\n",
              " \"An approximation trichotomy for Boolean #CSP.  We give a trichotomy theorem for the complexity of approximately counting the number of satisfying assignments of a Boolean CSP instance. Such problems are parameterised by a constraint language specifying the relations that may be used in constraints. If every relation in the constraint language is affine then the number of satisfying assignments can be exactly counted in polynomial time. Otherwise, if every relation in the constraint language is in the co-clone IM_2 from Post's lattice, then the problem of counting satisfying assignments is complete with respect to approximation-preserving reductions in the complexity class #RH\\\\Pi_1. This means that the problem of approximately counting satisfying assignments of such a CSP instance is equivalent in complexity to several other known counting problems, including the problem of approximately counting the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph. For every other fixed constraint language, the problem is complete for #P with respect to approximation-preserving reductions, meaning that there is no fully polynomial randomised approximation scheme for counting satisfying assignments unless NP=RP.\",\n",
              " 'A Multi-level Blocking Distinct Degree Factorization Algorithm.  We give a new algorithm for performing the distinct-degree factorization of a polynomial P(x) over GF(2), using a multi-level blocking strategy. The coarsest level of blocking replaces GCD computations by multiplications, as suggested by Pollard (1975), von zur Gathen and Shoup (1992), and others. The novelty of our approach is that a finer level of blocking replaces multiplications by squarings, which speeds up the computation in GF(2)[x]/P(x) of certain interval polynomials when P(x) is sparse. As an application we give a fast algorithm to search for all irreducible trinomials x^r + x^s + 1 of degree r over GF(2), while producing a certificate that can be checked in less time than the full search. Naive algorithms cost O(r^2) per trinomial, thus O(r^3) to search over all trinomials of given degree r. Under a plausible assumption about the distribution of factors of trinomials, the new algorithm has complexity O(r^2 (log r)^{3/2}(log log r)^{1/2}) for the search over all trinomials of degree r. Our implementation achieves a speedup of greater than a factor of 560 over the naive algorithm in the case r = 24036583 (a Mersenne exponent). Using our program, we have found two new primitive trinomials of degree 24036583 over GF(2) (the previous record degree was 6972593).',\n",

In geometric terms, this corresponds to characterizing the projective linear subvarieties of the Grassmann variety with its Plucker embedding. When the base field is finite, we consider the more general question of determining the maximum number of points on sections of Grassmannians by linear subvarieties of a fixed (co)dimension. This corresponds to a known open problem of determining the complete weight hierarchy of linear error correcting codes associated to Grassmann varieties. We recover most of the known results as well as prove some new results. In the process we obtain, and utilize, a simple generalization of the Griesmer-Wei bound for arbitrary linear codes.',\n",

              " 'Fuzzy Private Matching (Extended Abstract).  In the private matching problem, a client and a server each hold a set of $n$ input elements. The client wants to privately compute the intersection of these two sets: he learns which elements he has in common with the server (and nothing more), while the server gains no information at all. In certain applications it would be useful to have a private matching protocol that reports a match even if two elements are only similar instead of equal. Such a private matching protocol is called \\\\emph{fuzzy}, and is useful, for instance, when elements may be inaccurate or corrupted by errors.   We consider the fuzzy private matching problem, in a semi-honest environment. Elements are similar if they match on $t$ out of $T$ attributes. First we show that the original solution proposed by Freedman et al. is incorrect. Subsequently we present two fuzzy private matching protocols. The first, simple, protocol has bit message complexity $O(n \\\\binom{T}{t} (T \\\\log{|D|}+k))$. The second, improved, protocol has a much better bit message complexity of $O(n T (\\\\log{|D|}+k))$, but here the client incurs a O(n) factor time complexity. Additionally, we present protocols based on the computation of the Hamming distance and on oblivious transfer, that have different, sometimes more efficient, performance characteristics.',\n",

Social networks are a prominent feature of many social media sites, a new generation of Web sites that allow users to create and share content. Sites such as Digg, Flickr, and Del.icio.us allow users to designate others as \"friends\" or \"contacts\" and provide a single-click interface to track friends\\' activity. How are these social networks used? Unlike pure social networking sites (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook), which allow users to articulate their online professional and personal relationships, social media sites are not, for the most part, aimed at helping users create or foster online relationships. Instead, we claim that social media users create social networks to express their tastes and interests, and use them to filter the vast stream of new submissions to find interesting content. Social networks, in fact, facilitate new ways of interacting with information: what we call social browsing. Through an extensive analysis of data from Digg and Flickr, we show that social browsing is one of the primary usage modalities on these social media sites. This finding has implications for how social media sites rate and personalize content.',\n",
              " 'Grassmannian Beamforming for MIMO Amplify-and-Forward Relaying.  In this paper, we derive the optimal transmitter/ receiver beamforming vectors and relay weighting matrix for the multiple-input multiple-output amplify-and-forward relay channel. The analysis is accomplished in two steps. In the first step, the direct link between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) is ignored and we show that the transmitter and the relay should map their signals to the strongest right singular vectors of the Tx-relay and relay-Rx channels. Based on the distributions of these vectors for independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh channels, the Grassmannian codebooks are used for quantizing and sending back the channel information to the transmitter and the relay. The simulation results show that even a few number of bits can considerably increase the link reliability in terms of bit error rate. For the second step, the direct link is considered in the problem model and we derive the optimization problem that identifies the optimal Tx beamforming vector. For the i.i.d Rayleigh channels, we show that the solution to this problem is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere and we justify the appropriateness of the Grassmannian codebook (for determining the optimal beamforming vector), both analytically and by simulation. Finally, a modified quantizing scheme is presented which introduces a negligible degradation in the system performance but significantly reduces the required number of feedback bits.',\n",
              " 'Codes from Zero-divisors and Units in Group Rings.  We describe and present a new construction method for codes using encodings from group rings. They consist primarily of two types: zero-divisor and unit-derived codes. Previous codes from group rings focused on ideals; for example cyclic codes are ideals in the group ring over a cyclic group. The fresh focus is on the encodings themselves, which only under very limited conditions result in ideals. We use the result that a group ring is isomorphic to a certain well-defined ring of matrices, and thus every group ring element has an associated matrix. This allows matrix algebra to be used as needed in the study and production of codes, enabling the creation of standard generator and check matrices. Group rings are a fruitful source of units and zero-divisors from which new codes result. Many code properties, such as being LDPC or self-dual, may be expressed as properties within the group ring thus enabling the construction of codes with these properties. The methods are general enabling the construction of codes with many types of group rings. There is no restriction on the ring and thus codes over the integers, over matrix rings or even over group rings themselves are possible and fruitful.',\n",

              " 'Bandwidth Partitioning in Decentralized Wireless Networks.  This paper addresses the following question, which is of interest in the design of a multiuser decentralized network. Given a total system bandwidth of W Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each transmission, how many frequency slots N of size W/N should the band be partitioned into in order to maximize the number of simultaneous links in the network? Dividing the available spectrum results in two competing effects. On the positive side, a larger N allows for more parallel, noninterfering communications to take place in the same area. On the negative side, a larger N increases the SINR requirement for each link because the same information rate must be achieved over less bandwidth. Exploring this tradeoff and determining the optimum value of N in terms of the system parameters is the focus of the paper. Using stochastic geometry, the optimal SINR threshold - which directly corresponds to the optimal spectral efficiency - is derived for both the low SNR (power-limited) and high SNR (interference-limited) regimes. This leads to the optimum choice of the number of frequency bands N in terms of the path loss exponent, power and noise spectral density, desired rate, and total bandwidth.',\n",

The problem of error control in random linear network coding is addressed from a matrix perspective that is closely related to the subspace perspective of K\\\\\"otter and Kschischang. A large class of constant-dimension subspace codes is investigated. It is shown that codes in this class can be easily constructed from rank-metric codes, while preserving their distance properties. Moreover, it is shown that minimum distance decoding of such subspace codes can be reformulated as a generalized decoding problem for rank-metric codes where partial information about the error is available. This partial information may be in the form of erasures (knowledge of an error location but not its value) and deviations (knowledge of an error value but not its location). Taking erasures and deviations into account (when they occur) strictly increases the error correction capability of a code: if $\\\\mu$ erasures and $\\\\delta$ deviations occur, then errors of rank $t$ can always be corrected provided that $2t \\\\leq d - 1 + \\\\mu + \\\\delta$, where $d$ is the minimum rank distance of the code.

We then briefly remind in an article aimed for December 2007, by appending two more equations into Section 3, a theoretical II-time scenario as a time model well-proposed for the phenomenon. The time model within the core of the proposal, plays a significant role in emphasizing the principle points on Objectives no. 1-8, Sub-hypothesis 3.1.2, mentioned in Article [arXiv:0710.0410].

This paper provides simple lower bounds on the number of iterations which is required for successful message-passing decoding of some important families of graph-based code ensembles (including low-density parity-check codes and variations of repeat-accumulate codes). The transmission of the code ensembles is assumed to take place over a binary erasure channel, and the bounds refer to the asymptotic case where we let the block length tend to infinity. The simplicity of the bounds derived in this paper stems from the fact that they are easily evaluated and are expressed in terms of some basic parameters of the ensemble which include the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes, the target bit erasure probability and the gap between the channel capacity and the design rate of the ensemble. This paper demonstrates that the number of iterations which is required for successful message-passing decoding scales at least like the inverse of the gap (in rate) to capacity, provided that the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes of these turbo-like ensembles does not vanish (hence, the number of iterations becomes unbounded as the gap to capacity vanishes).',\n",

A \"clique minor\" in a graph G can be thought of as a set of connected subgraphs in G that are pairwise disjoint and pairwise adjacent. The \"Hadwiger number\" h(G) is the maximum cardinality of a clique minor in G. This paper studies clique minors in the Cartesian product G*H.   Our main result is a rough structural characterisation theorem for Cartesian products with bounded Hadwiger number. It implies that if the product of two sufficiently large graphs has bounded Hadwiger number then it is one of the following graphs:   - a planar grid with a vortex of bounded width in the outerface,   - a cylindrical grid with a vortex of bounded width in each of the two `big\\' faces, or   - a toroidal grid.   Motivation for studying the Hadwiger number of a graph includes Hadwiger\\'s Conjecture, which states that the chromatic number chi(G) <= h(G). It is open whether Hadwiger\\'s Conjecture holds for every Cartesian product. We prove that if |V(H)|-1 >= chi(G) >= chi(H) then Hadwiger\\'s Conjecture holds for G*H. On the other hand, we prove that Hadwiger\\'s Conjecture holds for all Cartesian products if and only if it holds for all G * K_2. We then show that h(G * K_2) is tied to the treewidth of G.

              " \"On Minimal Tree Realizations of Linear Codes.  A tree decomposition of the coordinates of a code is a mapping from the coordinate set to the set of vertices of a tree. A tree decomposition can be extended to a tree realization, i.e., a cycle-free realization of the code on the underlying tree, by specifying a state space at each edge of the tree, and a local constraint code at each vertex of the tree. The constraint complexity of a tree realization is the maximum dimension of any of its local constraint codes. A measure of the complexity of maximum-likelihood decoding for a code is its treewidth, which is the least constraint complexity of any of its tree realizations.   It is known that among all tree realizations of a code that extends a given tree decomposition, there exists a unique minimal realization that minimizes the state space dimension at each vertex of the underlying tree. In this paper, we give two new constructions of these minimal realizations. As a by-product of the first construction, a generalization of the state-merging procedure for trellis realizations, we obtain the fact that the minimal tree realization also minimizes the local constraint code dimension at each vertex of the underlying tree. The second construction relies on certain code decomposition techniques that we develop. We further observe that the treewidth of a code is related to a measure of graph complexity, also called treewidth. We exploit this connection to resolve a conjecture of Forney's regarding the gap between the minimum trellis constraint complexity and the treewidth of a code. We present a family of codes for which this gap can be arbitrarily large.\",\n",
              " \"Capacity as a Fundamental Metric for Mechanism Design in the Information   Economy.  The auction theory literature has so far focused mostly on the design of mechanisms that takes the revenue or the efficiency as a yardstick. However, scenarios where the {\\\\it capacity}, which we define as \\\\textit{``the number of bidders the auctioneer wants to have a positive probability of getting the item''}, is a fundamental concern are ubiquitous in the information economy. For instance, in sponsored search auctions (SSA's) or in online ad-exchanges, the true value of an ad-slot for an advertiser is inherently derived from the conversion-rate, which in turn depends on whether the advertiser actually obtained the ad-slot or not; thus, unless the capacity of the underlying auction is large, key parameters, such as true valuations and advertiser-specific conversion rates, will remain unknown or uncertain leading to inherent inefficiencies in the system. In general, the same holds true for all information goods/digital goods. We initiate a study of mechanisms, which take capacity as a yardstick, in addition to revenue/efficiency. We show that in the case of a single indivisible item one simple way to incorporate capacity constraints is via designing mechanisms to sell probability distributions, and that under certain conditions, such optimal probability distributions could be identified using a Linear programming approach. We define a quantity called {\\\\it price of capacity} to capture the tradeoff between capacity and revenue/efficiency. We also study the case of sponsored search auctions. Finally, we discuss how general such an approach via probability spikes can be made, and potential directions for future investigations.\",\n",
              " 'Data Structures for Mergeable Trees.  Motivated by an application in computational topology, we consider a novel variant of the problem of efficiently maintaining dynamic rooted trees. This variant requires merging two paths in a single operation. In contrast to the standard problem, in which only one tree arc changes at a time, a single merge operation can change many arcs. In spite of this, we develop a data structure that supports merges on an n-node forest in O(log^2 n) amortized time and all other standard tree operations in O(log n) time (amortized, worst-case, or randomized depending on the underlying data structure). For the special case that occurs in the motivating application, in which arbitrary arc deletions (cuts) are not allowed, we give a data structure with an O(log n) time bound per operation. This is asymptotically optimal under certain assumptions. For the even-more special case in which both cuts and parent queries are disallowed, we give an alternative O(log n)-time solution that uses standard dynamic trees as a black box. This solution also applies to the motivating application. Our methods use previous work on dynamic trees in various ways, but the analysis of each algorithm requires novel ideas. We also investigate lower bounds for the problem under various assumptions.',\n",

Counting the number of all the matchings on a bipartite graph has been transformed into calculating the permanent of a matrix obtained from the extended bipartite graph by Yan Huo, and Rasmussen presents a simple approach (RM) to approximate the permanent, which just yields a critical ratio O($n\\\\omega(n)$) for almost all the 0-1 matrices, provided it's a simple promising practical way to compute this #P-complete problem. In this paper, the performance of this method will be shown when it's applied to compute all the matchings based on that transformation. The critical ratio will be proved to be very large with a certain probability, owning an increasing factor larger than any polynomial of $n$ even in the sense for almost all the 0-1 matrices. Hence, RM fails to work well when counting all the matchings via computing the permanent of the matrix. In other words, we must carefully utilize the known methods of estimating the permanent to count all the matchings through that transformation.\",\n",

The deletion--contraction algorithm is perhaps the most popular method for computing a host of fundamental graph invariants such as the chromatic, flow, and reliability polynomials in graph theory, the Jones polynomial of an alternating link in knot theory, and the partition functions of the models of Ising, Potts, and Fortuin--Kasteleyn in statistical physics. Prior to this work, deletion--contraction was also the fastest known general-purpose algorithm for these invariants, running in time roughly proportional to the number of spanning trees in the input graph. Here, we give a substantially faster algorithm that computes the Tutte polynomial--and hence, all the aforementioned invariants and more--of an arbitrary graph in time within a polynomial factor of the number of connected vertex sets. The algorithm actually evaluates a multivariate generalization of the Tutte polynomial by making use of an identity due to Fortuin and Kasteleyn.

We consider a MIMO fading broadcast channel and compute achievable ergodic rates when channel state information is acquired at the receivers via downlink training and it is provided to the transmitter by channel state feedback. Unquantized (analog) and quantized (digital) channel state feedback schemes are analyzed and compared under various assumptions. Digital feedback is shown to be potentially superior when the feedback channel uses per channel state coefficient is larger than 1. Also, we show that by proper design of the digital feedback link, errors in the feedback have a minor effect even if simple uncoded modulation is used on the feedback channel. We discuss first the case of an unfaded AWGN feedback channel with orthogonal access and then the case of fading MIMO multi-access (MIMO-MAC). We show that by exploiting the MIMO-MAC nature of the uplink channel, a much better scaling of the feedback channel resource with the number of base station antennas can be achieved. Finally, for the case of delayed feedback, we show that in the realistic case where the fading process has (normalized) maximum Doppler frequency shift 0 < F < 1/2, a fraction 1 - 2F of the optimal multiplexing gain is achievable. The general conclusion of this work is that very significant downlink throughput is achievable with simple and efficient channel state feedback, provided that the feedback link is properly designed.',\n",

In recent work, Ozgur, Leveque, and Tse (2007) obtained a complete scaling characterization of throughput scaling for random extended wireless networks (i.e., $n$ nodes are placed uniformly at random in a square region of area $n$). They showed that for small path-loss exponents $\\\\alpha\\\\in(2,3]$ cooperative communication is order optimal, and for large path-loss exponents $\\\\alpha > 3$ multi-hop communication is order optimal. However, their results (both the communication scheme and the proof technique) are strongly dependent on the regularity induced with high probability by the random node placement.   In this paper, we consider the problem of characterizing the throughput scaling in extended wireless networks with arbitrary node placement. As a main result, we propose a more general novel cooperative communication scheme that works for arbitrarily placed nodes. For small path-loss exponents $\\\\alpha \\\\in (2,3]$, we show that our scheme is order optimal for all node placements, and achieves exactly the same throughput scaling as in Ozgur et al. This shows that the regularity of the node placement does not affect the scaling of the achievable rates for $\\\\alpha\\\\in (2,3]$. The situation is, however, markedly different for large path-loss exponents $\\\\alpha >3$. We show that in this regime the scaling of the achievable per-node rates depends crucially on the regularity of the node placement. We then present a family of schemes that smoothly \"interpolate\" between multi-hop and cooperative communication, depending upon the level of regularity in the node placement. We establish order optimality of these schemes under adversarial node placement for $\\\\alpha > 3$.',\n",

In this paper, we consider the nonasymptotic sequential estimation of means of random variables bounded in between zero and one. We have rigorously demonstrated that, in order to guarantee prescribed relative precision and confidence level, it suffices to continue sampling until the sample sum is no less than a certain bound and then take the average of samples as an estimate for the mean of the bounded random variable. We have developed an explicit formula and a bisection search method for the determination of such bound of sample sum, without any knowledge of the bounded variable. Moreover, we have derived bounds for the distribution of sample size. In the special case of Bernoulli random variables, we have established analytical and numerical methods to further reduce the bound of sample sum and thus improve the efficiency of sampling. Furthermore, the fallacy of existing results are detected and analyzed.',\n",

We explore the degrees of freedom of $M\\\\times N$ user wireless $X$ networks, i.e. networks of $M$ transmitters and $N$ receivers where every transmitter has an independent message for every receiver. We derive a general outerbound on the degrees of freedom \\\\emph{region} of these networks. When all nodes have a single antenna and all channel coefficients vary in time or frequency, we show that the \\\\emph{total} number of degrees of freedom of the $X$ network is equal to $\\\\frac{MN}{M+N-1}$ per orthogonal time and frequency dimension. Achievability is proved by constructing interference alignment schemes for $X$ networks that can come arbitrarily close to the outerbound on degrees of freedom. For the case where either M=2 or N=2 we find that the outerbound is exactly achievable. While $X$ networks have significant degrees of freedom benefits over interference networks when the number of users is small, our results show that as the number of users increases, this advantage disappears. Thus, for large $K$, the $K\\\\times K$ user wireless $X$ network loses half the degrees of freedom relative to the $K\\\\times K$ MIMO outerbound achievable through full cooperation. Interestingly, when there are few transmitters sending to many receivers ($N\\\\gg M$) or many transmitters sending to few receivers ($M\\\\gg N$), $X$ networks are able to approach the $\\\\min(M,N)$ degrees of freedom possible with full cooperation on the $M\\\\times N$ MIMO channel.

The notion of optimality naturally arises in many areas of applied mathematics and computer science concerned with decision making. Here we consider this notion in the context of three formalisms used for different purposes in reasoning about multi-agent systems: strategic games, CP-nets, and soft constraints. To relate the notions of optimality in these formalisms we introduce a natural qualitative modification of the notion of a strategic game. We show then that the optimal outcomes of a CP-net are exactly the Nash equilibria of such games. This allows us to use the techniques of game theory to search for optimal outcomes of CP-nets and vice-versa, to use techniques developed for CP-nets to search for Nash equilibria of the considered games. Then, we relate the notion of optimality used in the area of soft constraints to that used in a generalization of strategic games, called graphical games. In particular we prove that for a natural class of soft constraints that includes weighted constraints every optimal solution is both a Nash equilibrium and Pareto efficient joint strategy. For a natural mapping in the other direction we show that Pareto efficient joint strategies coincide with the optimal solutions of soft constraints.',\n",

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a relatively new supervised classification technique to the land cover mapping community. They have their roots in Statistical Learning Theory and have gained prominence because they are robust, accurate and are effective even when using a small training sample. By their nature SVMs are essentially binary classifiers, however, they can be adopted to handle the multiple classification tasks common in remote sensing studies. The two approaches commonly used are the One-Against-One (1A1) and One-Against-All (1AA) techniques. In this paper, these approaches are evaluated in as far as their impact and implication for land cover mapping. The main finding from this research is that whereas the 1AA technique is more predisposed to yielding unclassified and mixed pixels, the resulting classification accuracy is not significantly different from 1A1 approach. It is the authors conclusion therefore that ultimately the choice of technique adopted boils down to personal preference and the uniqueness of the dataset at hand.',\n",

This paper considers the problem of selecting a subset of nodes in a two-hop wireless network to act as relays in aiding the communication between the source-destination pair. Optimal relay subset selection with the objective of maximizing the overall throughput is a difficult problem that depends on multiple factors including node locations, queue lengths and power consumption. A partial decode-and-forward strategy is applied in this paper to improve the tractability of the relay selection problem and performance of the overall network.   Note that the number of relays selected ultimately determines the performance of the network. This paper benchmarks this performance by determining the net diversity achieved using the relays selected and the partial decode-and-forward strategy. This framework is subsequently used to further transform relay selection into a simpler relay placement problem, and two proximity-based approximation algorithms are developed to determine the appropriate set of relays to be selected in the network. Other selection strategies such as random relay selection and a greedy algorithm that relies on channel state information are also presented. This paper concludes by showing that the proposed proximity-based relay selection strategies yield near-optimal expected rates for a small number of selected relays.',\n",

Bregman divergences are versatile, and unify quadratic geometric distances with various statistical entropic measures. Because Bregman divergences are typically asymmetric, we consider both the left-sided and right-sided centroids and the symmetrized centroids, and prove that all three are unique. We give closed-form solutions for the sided centroids that are generalized means, and design a provably fast and efficient approximation algorithm for the symmetrized centroid based on its exact geometric characterization that requires solely to walk on the geodesic linking the two sided centroids. We report on our generic implementation for computing entropic centers of image clusters and entropic centers of multivariate normals, and compare our results with former ad-hoc methods.',\n",
              " 'A Distributed Dynamic Frequency Allocation Algorithm.  We consider a network model where the nodes are grouped into a number of clusters and propose a distributed dynamic frequency allocation algorithm that achieves performance close to that of a centralized optimal algorithm. Each cluster chooses its transmission frequency band based on its knowledge of the interference that it experiences. The convergence of the proposed distributed algorithm to a sub-optimal frequency allocation pattern is proved. For some specific cases of spatial distributions of the clusters in the network, asymptotic bounds on the performance of the algorithm are derived and comparisons to the performance of optimal centralized solutions are made. These analytic results and additional simulation studies verify performance close to that of an optimum centralized frequency allocation algorithm. It is demonstrated that the algorithm achieves about 90% of the Shannon capacities corresponding to the optimum/near-optimum centralized frequency band assignments. Furthermore, we consider the scenario where each cluster can be in active or inactive mode according to a two-state Markov model. We derive conditions to guarantee finite steady state variance for the output of the algorithm using stochastic analysis. Further simulation studies confirm the results of stochastic modeling and the performance of the algorithm in the time-varying setup.',\n",

Block diagonalization is a linear precoding technique for the multiple antenna broadcast (downlink) channel that involves transmission of multiple data streams to each receiver such that no multi-user interference is experienced at any of the receivers. This low-complexity scheme operates only a few dB away from capacity but requires very accurate channel knowledge at the transmitter. We consider a limited feedback system where each receiver knows its channel perfectly, but the transmitter is only provided with a finite number of channel feedback bits from each receiver. Using a random quantization argument, we quantify the throughput loss due to imperfect channel knowledge as a function of the feedback level. The quality of channel knowledge must improve proportional to the SNR in order to prevent interference-limitations, and we show that scaling the number of feedback bits linearly with the system SNR is sufficient to maintain a bounded rate loss. Finally, we compare our quantization strategy to an analog feedback scheme and show the superiority of quantized feedback.',\n",

The restless bandit problem is one of the most well-studied generalizations of the celebrated stochastic multi-armed bandit problem in decision theory. In its ultimate generality, the restless bandit problem is known to be PSPACE-Hard to approximate to any non-trivial factor, and little progress has been made despite its importance in modeling activity allocation under uncertainty.   We consider a special case that we call Feedback MAB, where the reward obtained by playing each of n independent arms varies according to an underlying on/off Markov process whose exact state is only revealed when the arm is played. The goal is to design a policy for playing the arms in order to maximize the infinite horizon time average expected reward. This problem is also an instance of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and is widely studied in wireless scheduling and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) routing. Unlike the stochastic MAB problem, the Feedback MAB problem does not admit to greedy index-based optimal policies.   We develop a novel and general duality-based algorithmic technique that yields a surprisingly simple and intuitive 2+epsilon-approximate greedy policy to this problem. We then define a general sub-class of restless bandit problems that we term Monotone bandits, for which our policy is a 2-approximation. Our technique is robust enough to handle generalizations of these problems to incorporate various side-constraints such as blocking plays and switching costs. This technique is also of independent interest for other restless bandit problems. By presenting the first (and efficient) O(1) approximations for non-trivial instances of restless bandits as well as of POMDPs, our work initiates the study of approximation algorithms in both these contexts.',\n",

The main contribution of this paper is to design an Information Retrieval (IR) technique based on Algorithmic Information Theory (using the Normalized Compression Distance- NCD), statistical techniques (outliers), and novel organization of data base structure. The paper shows how they can be integrated to retrieve information from generic databases using long (text-based) queries. Two important problems are analyzed in the paper. On the one hand, how to detect \"false positives\" when the distance among the documents is very low and there is actual similarity. On the other hand, we propose a way to structure a document database which similarities distance estimation depends on the length of the selected text. Finally, the experimental evaluations that have been carried out to study previous problems are shown.',\n",
              " \"Exploiting Multi-Antennas for Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing in   Cognitive Radio Networks.  In cognitive radio (CR) networks, there are scenarios where the secondary (lower priority) users intend to communicate with each other by opportunistically utilizing the transmit spectrum originally allocated to the existing primary (higher priority) users. For such a scenario, a secondary user usually has to trade off between two conflicting goals at the same time: one is to maximize its own transmit throughput; and the other is to minimize the amount of interference it produces at each primary receiver. In this paper, we study this fundamental tradeoff from an information-theoretic perspective by characterizing the secondary user's channel capacity under both its own transmit-power constraint as well as a set of interference-power constraints each imposed at one of the primary receivers. In particular, this paper exploits multi-antennas at the secondary transmitter to effectively balance between spatial multiplexing for the secondary transmission and interference avoidance at the primary receivers. Convex optimization techniques are used to design algorithms for the optimal secondary transmit spatial spectrum that achieves the capacity of the secondary transmission. Suboptimal solutions for ease of implementation are also presented and their performances are compared with the optimal solution. Furthermore, algorithms developed for the single-channel transmission are also extended to the case of multi-channel transmission whereby the secondary user is able to achieve opportunistic spectrum sharing via transmit adaptations not only in space, but in time and frequency domains as well.\",\n",

              " 'Approximation Algorithms for Orienteering with Time Windows.  Orienteering is the following optimization problem: given an edge-weighted graph (directed or undirected), two nodes s,t and a time limit T, find an s-t walk of total length at most T that maximizes the number of distinct nodes visited by the walk. One obtains a generalization, namely orienteering with time-windows (also referred to as TSP with time-windows), if each node v has a specified time-window [R(v), D(v)] and a node v is counted as visited by the walk only if v is visited during its time-window. For the time-window problem, an O(\\\\log \\\\opt) approximation can be achieved even for directed graphs if the algorithm is allowed quasi-polynomial time. However, the best known polynomial time approximation ratios are O(\\\\log^2 \\\\opt) for undirected graphs and O(\\\\log^4 \\\\opt) in directed graphs. In this paper we make some progress towards closing this discrepancy, and in the process obtain improved approximation ratios in several natural settings. Let L(v) = D(v) - R(v) denote the length of the time-window for v and let \\\\lmax = \\\\max_v L(v) and \\\\lmin = \\\\min_v L(v).

We consider a multi-channel opportunistic communication system where the states of these channels evolve as independent and statistically identical Markov chains (the Gilbert-Elliot channel model). A user chooses one channel to sense and access in each slot and collects a reward determined by the state of the chosen channel. The problem is to design a sensing policy for channel selection to maximize the average reward, which can be formulated as a multi-arm restless bandit process. In this paper, we study the structure, optimality, and performance of the myopic sensing policy. We show that the myopic sensing policy has a simple robust structure that reduces channel selection to a round-robin procedure and obviates the need for knowing the channel transition probabilities. The optimality of this simple policy is established for the two-channel case and conjectured for the general case based on numerical results. The performance of the myopic sensing policy is analyzed, which, based on the optimality of myopic sensing, characterizes the maximum throughput of a multi-channel opportunistic communication system and its scaling behavior with respect to the number of channels. These results apply to cognitive radio networks, opportunistic transmission in fading environments, and resource-constrained jamming and anti-jamming.',\n",

In singular statistical models, neither the Bayes a posteriori distribution converges to the normal distribution nor the maximum likelihood estimator satisfies asymptotic normality. This is the main reason why it has been difficult to predict their generalization performances from trained states. In this paper, we study four errors, (1) Bayes generalization error, (2) Bayes training error, (3) Gibbs generalization error, and (4) Gibbs training error, and prove that there are mathematical relations among these errors. The formulas proved in this paper are equations of states in statistical estimation because they hold for any true distribution, any parametric model, and any a priori distribution.

              " 'The price of ignorance: The impact of side-information on delay for   lossless source-coding.  Inspired by the context of compressing encrypted sources, this paper considers the general tradeoff between rate, end-to-end delay, and probability of error for lossless source coding with side-information. The notion of end-to-end delay is made precise by considering a sequential setting in which source symbols are revealed in real time and need to be reconstructed at the decoder within a certain fixed latency requirement. Upper bounds are derived on the reliability functions with delay when side-information is known only to the decoder as well as when it is also known at the encoder.   When the encoder is not ignorant of the side-information (including the trivial case when there is no side-information), it is possible to have substantially better tradeoffs between delay and probability of error at all rates. This shows that there is a fundamental price of ignorance in terms of end-to-end delay when the encoder is not aware of the side information. This effect is not visible if only fixed-block-length codes are considered. In this way, side-information in source-coding plays a role analogous to that of feedback in channel coding.   While the theorems in this paper are asymptotic in terms of long delays and low probabilities of error, an example is used to show that the qualitative effects described here are significant even at short and moderate delays.',\n",

Using large deviations techniques, we show that classical data transmitted in either of two Fourier-conjugate bases for the coding subspace can be decoded with low probability of error. A recently discovered information-uncertainty relation then implies that the quantum mutual information for entanglement encoded into the subspace and transmitted through the channel will be high. The monogamy of quantum correlations finally implies that the environment of the channel cannot be significantly coupled to the entanglement, and concluding, which ensures the existence of a decoding by the receiver.\",\n",

Using the SPIRES literature database we reconstruct the astro-ph listings from July 2002 to December 2005 and determine citation counts for e-prints from their ADS entry. We use Zipf plots to analyze the citation distributions for each astro-ph position. We find that e-prints appearing at or near the top of the astro-ph mailings receive significantly more citations than those further down the list. This difference is significant at the 7 sigma level and on average amounts to two times more citations for papers at the top than those further down the listing. We propose three possible non-exclusive explanations for this positional citation effect and try to test them. We conclude that self-promotion by authors plays a role in the observed effect but cannot exclude that increased visibility at the top of the daily listings contributes to higher citation counts as well. We can rule out that the positional dependence of citations is caused by the coincidence of the submission deadline with the working hours of a geographically constrained set of intrinsically higher cited authors. We discuss several ways of mitigating the observed effect, including splitting astro-ph into several subject classes, randomizing the order of e-prints, and a novel approach to sorting entries by relevance to individual readers.',\n",

The most widely known MAXS AT algorithms are ineffective at solving hard problems instances from practical application domains. Recent work proposed using efficient Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers for solving the MaxSAT problem, based on identifying and eliminating unsatisfiable subformulas. However, these algorithms do not scale in practice. This paper analyzes existing MaxSAT algorithms based on unsatisfiable subformula identification. Moreover, the paper proposes a number of key optimizations to these MaxSAT algorithms and a new alternative algorithm. The proposed optimizations and the new algorithm provide significant performance improvements on MaxSAT instances from practical applications.

Identifying strongly connected substructures in large networks provides insight into their coarse-grained organization. Several approaches based on the optimization of a quality function, e.g., the modularity, have been proposed. We present here a multistep extension of the greedy algorithm (MSG) that allows the merging of more than one pair of communities at each iteration step. The essential idea is to prevent the premature condensation into few large communities. Upon convergence of the MSG a simple refinement procedure called \"vertex mover\" (VM) is used for reassigning vertices to neighboring communities to improve the final modularity value. With an appropriate choice of the step width, the combined MSG-VM algorithm is able to find solutions of higher modularity than those reported previously. The multistep extension does not alter the scaling of computational cost of the greedy algorithm.',\n",
              " 'Opportunistic Relaying in Wireless Networks.  Relay networks having $n$ source-to-destination pairs and $m$ half-duplex relays, all operating in the same frequency band in the presence of block fading, are analyzed. This setup has attracted significant attention and several relaying protocols have been reported in the literature. However, most of the proposed solutions require either centrally coordinated scheduling or detailed channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter side. Here, an opportunistic relaying scheme is proposed, which alleviates these limitations. The scheme entails a two-hop communication protocol, in which sources communicate with destinations only through half-duplex relays. The key idea is to schedule at each hop only a subset of nodes that can benefit from \\\\emph{multiuser diversity}. To select the source and destination nodes for each hop, it requires only CSI at receivers (relays for the first hop, and destination nodes for the second hop) and an integer-value CSI feedback to the transmitters. For the case when $n$ is large and $m$ is fixed, it is shown that the proposed scheme achieves a system throughput of $m/2$ bits/s/Hz. In contrast, the information-theoretic upper bound of $(m/2)\\\\log \\\\log n$ bits/s/Hz is achievable only with more demanding CSI assumptions and cooperation between the relays. Furthermore, it is shown that, under the condition that the product of block duration and system bandwidth scales faster than $\\\\log n$, the achievable throughput of the proposed scheme scales as $\\\\Theta ({\\\\log n})$. Notably, this is proven to be the optimal throughput scaling even if centralized scheduling is allowed, thus proving the optimality of the proposed scheme in the scaling law sense.',\n",

Computability logic (CL) (see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html) is a semantical platform and research program for redeveloping logic as a formal theory of computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth which it has more traditionally been. Formulas in CL stand for (interactive) computational problems, understood as games between a machine and its environment; logical operators represent operations on such entities; and \"truth\" is understood as existence of an effective solution, i.e., of an algorithmic winning strategy.   The formalism of CL is open-ended, and may undergo series of extensions as the study of the subject advances. The main groups of operators on which CL has been focused so far are the parallel, choice, branching, and blind operators. The present paper introduces a new important group of operators, called sequential. The latter come in the form of sequential conjunction and disjunction, sequential quantifiers, and sequential recurrences. As the name may suggest, the algorithmic intuitions associated with this group are those of sequential computations, as opposed to the intuitions of parallel computations associated with the parallel group of operations: playing a sequential combination of games means playing its components in a sequential fashion, one after one.   The main technical result of the present paper is a sound and complete axiomatization of the propositional fragment of computability logic whose vocabulary, together with negation, includes all three -- parallel, choice and sequential -- sorts of conjunction and disjunction. An extension of this result to the first-order level is also outlined.',\n",

Markov random fields are used to model high dimensional distributions in a number of applied areas. Much recent interest has been devoted to the reconstruction of the dependency structure from independent samples from the Markov random fields.

              " 'Distributed Consensus Algorithms in Sensor Networks: Quantized Data and   Random Link Failures.  The paper studies the problem of distributed average consensus in sensor networks with quantized data and random link failures. To achieve consensus, dither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When the quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels), stochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with probability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that the meansquared error (m.s.e.) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link weight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm. To study dithered consensus with random links when the range of the quantizer is bounded, we establish uniform boundedness of the sample paths of the unbounded quantizer. This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the supremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is accomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components: one along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to the consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale and supermartingale sequences. From these, we derive probability bounds on the excursions of the two subsequences, from which probability bounds on the excursions of the quantizer state vector follow. The paper shows how to use these probability bounds to design the quantizer parameters and to explore tradeoffs among the number of quantizer levels, the size of the quantization steps, the desired probability of saturation, and the desired level of accuracy $\\\\epsilon$ away from consensus. Finally, the paper illustrates the quantizer design with a numerical study.',\n",
              " \"Non-linear and Linear Broadcasting with QoS Requirements: Tractable   Approaches for Bounded Channel Uncertainties.  We consider the downlink of a cellular system in which the base station employs multiple transmit antennas, each receiver has a single antenna, and the users specify. We consider communication schemes in which the users have certain Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. We study the design of robust broadcasting schemes that minimize the transmission power necessary to guarantee that the QoS requirements are satisfied for all channels within bounded uncertainty regions around the transmitter's estimate of each user's channel. Each user's QoS requirement is formulated as a constraint on the mean square error (MSE) in its received signal, and we show that these MSE constraints imply constraints on the received SINR. Using the MSE constraints, we present a unified design approach for robust linear and non-linear transceivers with QoS requirements. The proposed designs overcome the limitations of existing approaches that provide conservative designs or are only applicable to the case of linear precoding. Furthermore, we provide computationally-efficient design formulations for a rather general model of channel uncertainty that subsumes many natural choices for the uncertainty region. We also consider the problem of the robust counterpart to precoding schemes that maximize the fidelity of the weakest user's signal subject to a power constraint. For this problem, we provide quasi-convex formulations, for both linear and non-linear transceivers, that can be efficiently solved using a one-dimensional bisection search. Our numerical results demonstrate that in the presence of CSI uncertainty, the proposed designs provide guarantees for a larger range of QoS requirements than the existing approaches, and consume require less transmission power in providing these guarantees.\",\n",

This work started out with our accidental discovery of a pattern of throughput distributions among links in IEEE 802.11 networks from experimental results. This pattern gives rise to an easy computation method, which we term back-of-the-envelop (BoE) computation, because for many network configurations, very accurate results can be obtained within minutes, if not seconds, by simple hand computation. BoE beats prior methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. While the computation procedure of BoE is simple, explaining why it works is by no means trivial. Indeed the majority of our investigative efforts have been devoted to the construction of a theory to explain BoE. This paper models an ideal CSMA network as a set of interacting on-off telegraph processes. In developing the theory, we discovered a number of analytical techniques and observations that have eluded prior research, such as that the carrier-sensing interactions among links in an ideal CSMA network result in a system state evolution that is time-reversible; and that the probability distribution of the system state is insensitive to the distributions of the \"on\" and \"off\" durations given their means, and is a Markov random field. We believe these theoretical frameworks are useful not just for explaining BoE, but could also be a foundation for a fundamental understanding of how links in CSMA networks interact. Last but not least, because of their basic nature, we surmise that some of the techniques and results developed in this paper may be applicable to not just CSMA networks, but also to other physical and engineering systems consisting of entities interacting with each other in time and space.',\n",

We also extend our common dissection result to edge-hinged dissections of solid 3D polyhedra that have a common (unhinged) dissection, as determined by Dehn's 1900 solution to Hilbert's Third Problem. Our proofs are constructive, giving explicit algorithms in all cases. For a constant number of planar polygons, both the number of pieces and running time required by our construction are pseudopolynomial. This bound is the best possible, even for unhinged dissections. Hinged dissections have possible applications to reconfigurable robotics, programmable matter, and nanomanufacturing.\",\n",

We exploit preshared entanglement and a convolutional coding structure to develop a theory of entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional coding. Our construction produces a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional code from two arbitrary classical binary convolutional codes. The rate and error-correcting properties of the classical convolutional codes directly determine the corresponding properties of the resulting entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional code.

              " 'Maximum-rate, Minimum-Decoding-Complexity STBCs from Clifford Algebras.  It is well known that Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) from orthogonal designs (ODs) are single-symbol decodable/symbol-by-symbol decodable (SSD) and are obtainable from unitary matrix representations of Clifford algebras. However, SSD codes are obtainable from designs that are not orthogonal also. Recently, two such classes of SSD codes have been studied: (i) Coordinate Interleaved Orthogonal Designs (CIODs) and (ii) Minimum-Decoding-Complexity (MDC) STBCs from Quasi-ODs (QODs). Codes from ODs, CIODs and MDC-QODs are mutually non-intersecting classes of codes. The class of CIODs have {\\\\it non-unitary weight matrices} when written as a Linear Dispersion Code (LDC) proposed by Hassibi and Hochwald, whereas several known SSD codes including CODs have {\\\\it unitary weight matrices}. In this paper, we obtain SSD codes with unitary weight matrices (that are not CODs) called Clifford Unitary Weight SSDs (CUW-SSDs) from matrix representations of Clifford algebras. A main result of this paper is the derivation of an achievable upper bound on the rate of any unitary weight SSD code as $\\\\frac{a}{2^{a-1}}$ for $2^a$ antennas which is larger than that of the CODs which is $\\\\frac{a+1}{2^a}$. It is shown that several known classes of SSD codes are CUW-SSD codes and CUW-SSD codes meet this upper bound. Also, for the codes of this paper conditions on the signal sets which ensure full-diversity and expressions for the coding gain are presented. A large class of SSD codes with non-unitary weight matrices are obtained which include CIODs as a proper subclass.',\n",

In this paper, collocated and distributed space-time block codes (DSTBCs) which admit multi-group maximum likelihood (ML) decoding are studied. First the collocated case is considered and the problem of constructing space-time block codes (STBCs) which optimally tradeoff rate and ML decoding complexity is posed. Recently, sufficient conditions for multi-group ML decodability have been provided in the literature and codes meeting these sufficient conditions were called Clifford Unitary Weight (CUW) STBCs. An algebraic framework based on extended Clifford algebras is proposed to study CUW STBCs and using this framework, the optimal tradeoff between rate and ML decoding complexity of CUW STBCs is obtained for few specific cases. Code constructions meeting this tradeoff optimally are also provided. The paper then focuses on multi-group ML decodable DSTBCs for application in synchronous wireless relay networks and three constructions of four-group ML decodable DSTBCs are provided. Finally, the OFDM based Alamouti space-time coded scheme proposed by Li-Xia for a 2 relay asynchronous relay network is extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full asynchronous cooperative diversity for arbitrary number of relays. It is then shown how differential encoding at the source can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme to arrive at a new transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity in asynchronous wireless relay networks with no channel information and also no timing error knowledge at the destination node. Four-group decodable DSTBCs applicable in the proposed OFDM based transmission scheme are also given.',\n",

The subject of this paper is the long-standing open problem of developing a general capacity theory for wireless networks, particularly a theory capable of describing the fundamental performance limits of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). A MANET is a peer-to-peer network with no pre-existing infrastructure. MANETs are the most general wireless networks, with single-hop, relay, interference, mesh, and star networks comprising special cases. The lack of a MANET capacity theory has stunted the development and commercialization of many types of wireless networks, including emergency, military, sensor, and community mesh networks. Information theory, which has been vital for links and centralized networks, has not been successfully applied to decentralized wireless networks. Even if this was accomplished, for such a theory to truly characterize the limits of deployed MANETs it must overcome three key roadblocks. First, most current capacity results rely on the allowance of unbounded delay and reliability. Second, spatial and timescale decompositions have not yet been developed for optimally modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of wireless networks. Third, a useful network capacity theory must integrate rather than ignore the important role of overhead messaging and feedback. This paper describes some of the shifts in thinking that may be needed to overcome these roadblocks and develop a more general theory that we refer to as non-equilibrium information theory.',\n",

More sophisticated models such as Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio (SINR) model, however, usually leads to directed graphs. In this paper, we study percolation processes in wireless networks modelled by directed SINR graphs. We first investigate interference-free networks, where we define four types of phase transitions and show that they take place at the same time. By coupling the directed SINR graph with two other undirected SINR graphs, we further obtain analytical upper and lower bounds on the critical density. Then, we show that with interference, percolation in directed SINR graphs depends not only on the density but also on the inverse system processing gain. We also provide bounds on the critical value of the inverse system processing gain.',\n",

              " 'Towards Persistence-Based Reconstruction in Euclidean Spaces.  Manifold reconstruction has been extensively studied for the last decade or so, especially in two and three dimensions. Recently, significant improvements were made in higher dimensions, leading to new methods to reconstruct large classes of compact subsets of Euclidean space $\\\\R^d$. However, the complexities of these methods scale up exponentially with d, which makes them impractical in medium or high dimensions, even for handling low-dimensional submanifolds. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that stands in-between classical reconstruction and topological estimation, and whose complexity scales up with the intrinsic dimension of the data. Specifically, when the data points are sufficiently densely sampled from a smooth $m$-submanifold of $\\\\R^d$, our method retrieves the homology of the submanifold in time at most $c(m)n^5$, where $n$ is the size of the input and $c(m)$ is a constant depending solely on $m$. It can also provably well handle a wide range of compact subsets of $\\\\R^d$, though with worse complexities. Along the way to proving the correctness of our algorithm, we obtain new results on \\\\v{C}ech, Rips, and witness complex filtrations in Euclidean spaces.',\n",

Convex polyhedral abstractions of logic programs have been found very useful in deriving numeric relationships between program arguments in order to prove program properties and in other areas such as termination and complexity analysis.

The tool is accessible on the web, permits user programs to be uploaded and analysed, and is integrated with related program transformations such as size abstractions and query-answer transformation. We then report some experiments using the tool, showing how it can be conveniently used to analyse transition systems arising from models of embedded systems, and an emulator for a PIC microcontroller which is used for example in wearable computing systems. We discuss issues including scalability, tradeoffs of precision and computation time, and other program transformations that can enhance the results of analysis.',\n",
              " 'Single-Exclusion Number and the Stopping Redundancy of MDS Codes.  For a linear block code C, its stopping redundancy is defined as the smallest number of check nodes in a Tanner graph for C, such that there exist no stopping sets of size smaller than the minimum distance of C. Schwartz and Vardy conjectured that the stopping redundancy of an MDS code should only depend on its length and minimum distance.   We define the (n,t)-single-exclusion number, S(n,t) as the smallest number of t-subsets of an n-set, such that for each i-subset of the n-set, i=1,...,t+1, there exists a t-subset that contains all but one element of the i-subset. New upper bounds on the single-exclusion number are obtained via probabilistic methods, recurrent inequalities, as well as explicit constructions. The new bounds are used to better understand the stopping redundancy of MDS codes. In particular, it is shown that for [n,k=n-d+1,d] MDS codes, as n goes to infinity, the stopping redundancy is asymptotic to S(n,d-2), if d=o(\\\\sqrt{n}), or if k=o(\\\\sqrt{n}) and k goes to infinity, thus giving partial confirmation of the Schwartz-Vardy conjecture in the asymptotic sense.',\n",
              " \"Density estimation in linear time.  We consider the problem of choosing a density estimate from a set of distributions F, minimizing the L1-distance to an unknown distribution (Devroye, Lugosi 2001). Devroye and Lugosi analyze two algorithms for the problem: Scheffe tournament winner and minimum distance estimate. The Scheffe tournament estimate requires fewer computations than the minimum distance estimate, but has strictly weaker guarantees than the latter.   We focus on the computational aspect of density estimation. We present two algorithms, both with the same guarantee as the minimum distance estimate. The first one, a modification of the minimum distance estimate, uses the same number (quadratic in |F|) of computations as the Scheffe tournament. The second one, called ``efficient minimum loss-weight estimate,'' uses only a linear number of computations, assuming that F is preprocessed.   We also give examples showing that the guarantees of the algorithms cannot be improved and explore randomized algorithms for density estimation.\",\n",

Motivated by the lossy compression of an active-vision video stream, we consider the problem of finding the rate-distortion function of an arbitrarily varying source (AVS) composed of a finite number of subsources with known distributions. Berger's paper `The Source Coding Game', \\\\emph{IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory}, 1971, solves this problem under the condition that the adversary is allowed only strictly causal access to the subsource realizations. We consider the case when the adversary has access to the subsource realizations non-causally. Using the type-covering lemma, this new rate-distortion function is determined to be the maximum of the IID rate-distortion function over a set of source distributions attainable by the adversary. We then extend the results to allow for partial or noisy observations of subsource realizations. We further explore the model by attempting to find the rate-distortion function when the adversary is actually helpful.   Finally, a bound is developed on the uniform continuity of the IID rate-distortion function for finite-alphabet sources. The bound is used to give a sufficient number of distributions that need to be sampled to compute the rate-distortion function of an AVS to within a certain accuracy. The bound is also used to give a rate of convergence for the estimate of the rate-distortion function for an unknown IID finite-alphabet source .\",\n",

Discrete-time Rayleigh fading single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels are considered, with no channel state information at the transmitter or the receiver. The fading is assumed to be stationary and correlated in time, but independent from antenna to antenna. Peak-power and average-power constraints are imposed on the transmit antennas. For MIMO channels, these constraints are either imposed on the sum over antennas, or on each individual antenna. For SISO channels and MIMO channels with sum power constraints, the asymptotic capacity as the peak signal-to-noise ratio tends to zero is identified; for MIMO channels with individual power constraints, this asymptotic capacity is obtained for a class of channels called transmit separable channels. The results for MIMO channels with individual power constraints are carried over to SISO channels with delay spread (i.e. frequency selective fading).',\n",

Given a general source with countably infinite source alphabet and a general channel with arbitrary abstract channel input/channel output alphabets, we study the joint source-channel coding problem from the information-spectrum point of view. First, we generalize Feinstein's lemma (direct part) and Verdu-Han's lemma (converse part) so as to be applicable to the general joint source-channel coding problem. Based on these lemmas, we establish a sufficient condition as well as a necessary condition for the source to be reliably transmissible over the channel with asymptotically vanishing probability of error. It is shown that our sufficient condition is equivalent to the sufficient condition derived by Vembu, Verdu and Steinberg, whereas our necessary condition is shown to be stronger than or equivalent to the necessary condition derived by them. It turns out, as a direct consequence, that separation principle in a relevantly generalized sense holds for a wide class of sources and channels, as was shown in a quite dfifferent manner by Vembu, Verdu and Steinberg. It should also be remarked that a nice duality is found between our necessary and sufficient conditions, whereas we cannot fully enjoy such a duality between the necessary condition and the sufficient condition by Vembu, Verdu and Steinberg. In addition, we demonstrate a sufficient condition as well as a necessary condition for the epsilon-transmissibility. Finally, the separation theorem of the traditional standard form is shown to hold for the class of sources and channels that satisfy the semi-strong converse property.\",\n",

In this paper, the capacity and energy efficiency of training-based communication schemes employed for transmission over a-priori unknown Rayleigh block fading channels are studied. In these schemes, periodically transmitted training symbols are used at the receiver to obtain the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) estimate of the channel fading coefficients. Initially, the case in which the product of the estimate error and transmitted signal is assumed to be Gaussian noise is considered. In this case, it is shown that bit energy requirements grow without bound as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to zero, and the minimum bit energy is achieved at a nonzero SNR value below which one should not operate. The effect of the block length on both the minimum bit energy and the SNR value at which the minimum is achieved is investigated. Flash training and transmission schemes are analyzed and shown to improve the energy efficiency in the low-SNR regime.   In the second part of the paper, the capacity and energy efficiency of training-based schemes are investigated when the channel input is subject to peak power constraints. The capacity-achieving input structure is characterized and the magnitude distribution of the optimal input is shown to be discrete with a finite number of mass points. The capacity, bit energy requirements, and optimal resource allocation strategies are obtained through numerical analysis. The bit energy is again shown to grow without bound as SNR decreases to zero due to the presence of peakedness constraints. The improvements in energy efficiency when on-off keying with fixed peak power and vanishing duty cycle is employed are studied. Comparisons of the performances of training-based and noncoherent transmission schemes are provided.',\n",

Korner and Marton established the capacity region for the 2-receiver broadcast channel with degraded message sets.

We establish the capacity region for a class of 3-receiver broadcast channels with 2 degraded message sets and show that it can be strictly larger than the straightforward extension of the Korner-Marton region. The key new idea is indirect decoding, whereby a receiver who cannot directly decode a cloud center, finds it indirectly by decoding satellite codewords. This idea is then used to establish new inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of the general 3-receiver broadcast channel with 2 and 3 degraded message sets. We show that these bounds are tight for some nontrivial cases.

In particular, the error and secrecy performance of repetition time diversity (RTD) and incremental redundancy (INR) protocols are investigated based on good Wyner code sequences, which ensure that the confidential message is decoded successfully by the legitimate receiver and is kept in total ignorance by the eavesdropper for a given set of channel realizations. This paper first illustrates that there exists a good rate-compatible Wyner code family which ensures a secure INR protocol. Next, two types of outage probabilities, connection outage and secrecy outage probabilities are defined in order to characterize the tradeoff between the reliability of the legitimate communication link and the confidentiality with respect to the eavesdropper's link. For a given connection/secrecy outage probability pair, an achievable throughput of secure HARQ protocols is derived for block-fading channels. Finally, both asymptotic analysis and numerical computations demonstrate the benefits of HARQ protocols to throughput and secrecy.\",\n",
              " \"Biology of Applied Digital Ecosystems.  A primary motivation for our research in Digital Ecosystems is the desire to exploit the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems. Ecosystems are thought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve complex, dynamic problems. However, the biological processes that contribute to these properties have not been made explicit in Digital Ecosystems research. Here, we discuss how biological properties contribute to the self-organising features of biological ecosystems, including population dynamics, evolution, a complex dynamic environment, and spatial distributions for generating local interactions. The potential for exploiting these properties in artificial systems is then considered. We suggest that several key features of biological ecosystems have not been fully explored in existing digital ecosystems, and discuss how mimicking these features may assist in developing robust, scalable self-organising architectures. An example architecture, the Digital Ecosystem, is considered in detail. The Digital Ecosystem is then measured experimentally through simulations, with measures originating from theoretical ecology, to confirm its likeness to a biological ecosystem. Including the responsiveness to requests for applications from the user base, as a measure of the 'ecological succession' (development).\",\n",
              " \"The Generalized Random Energy Model and its Application to the   Statistical Physics of Ensembles of Hierarchical Codes.  In an earlier work, the statistical physics associated with finite--temperature decoding of code ensembles, along with the relation to their random coding error exponents, were explored in a framework that is analogous to Derrida's random energy model (REM) of spin glasses, according to which the energy levels of the various spin configurations are independent random variables. The generalized REM (GREM) extends the REM in that it introduces correlations between energy levels in an hierarchical structure. In this paper, we explore some analogies between the behavior of the GREM and that of code ensembles which have parallel hierarchical structures. In particular, in analogy to the fact that the GREM may have different types of phase transition effects, depending on the parameters of the model, then the above--mentioned hierarchical code ensembles behave substantially differently in the various domains of the design parameters of these codes. We make an attempt to explore the insights that can be imported from the statistical mechanics of the GREM and be harnessed to serve for code design considerations and guidelines.\",\n",

This paper gives the first separation of quantum and classical pure (i.e., non-cryptographic) computing abilities with no restriction on the amount of available computing resources, by considering the exact solvability of a celebrated unsolvable problem in classical distributed computing, the ``leader election problem'' on anonymous networks. The goal of the leader election problem is to elect a unique leader from among distributed parties. The paper considers this problem for anonymous networks, in which each party has the same identifier. It is well-known that no classical algorithm can solve exactly (i.e., in bounded time without error) the leader election problem in anonymous networks, even if it is given the number of parties. This paper gives two quantum algorithms that, given the number of parties, can exactly solve the problem for any network topology in polynomial rounds and polynomial communication/time complexity with respect to the number of parties, when the parties are connected by quantum communication links.\",\n",

Weak affine light typing (WALT) assigns light affine linear formulae as types to a subset of lambda-terms in System F. WALT is poly-time sound: if a lambda-term M has type in WALT, M can be evaluated with a polynomial cost in the dimension of the derivation that gives it a type. In particular, the evaluation can proceed under any strategy of a rewriting relation, obtained as a mix of both call-by-name/call-by-value beta-reductions. WALT is poly-time complete since it can represent any poly-time Turing machine. WALT weakens, namely generalizes, the notion of stratification of deductions common to some Light Systems -- we call as such those logical systems, derived from Linear logic, to characterize FP, the set of Polynomial functions -- . A weaker stratification allows to define a compositional embedding of the Quasi-linear fragment QlSRN of Safe recursion on notation (SRN) into WALT. QlSRN is SRN, which is a recursive-theoretical system characterizing FP, where only the composition scheme is restricted to linear safe variables. So, the expressivity of WALT is stronger, as compared to the known Light Systems. In particular, using the types, the embedding puts in evidence the stratification of normal and safe arguments hidden in QlSRN: the less an argument is impredicative, the deeper, in a formal, proof-theoretical sense, gets its representation in WALT.',\n",

A generic method to derive subsystem codes from existing subsystem codes is given that allows one to trade the dimensions of subsystem and co-subsystem while maintaining or improving the minimum distance. As a consequence, it is shown that all pure MDS subsystem codes are derived from MDS stabilizer codes. The existence of numerous families of MDS subsystem codes is established.

The network implements linear network coding to deliver $n$ packets from source to each receiver, and the wiretapper can eavesdrop on $\\\\mu$ arbitrarily chosen links. A coding scheme is proposed that can achieve the maximum possible rate of $k=n-\\\\mu$ packets that are information-theoretically secure from the adversary. A distinctive feature of our scheme is that it is universal: it can be applied on top of any communication network without requiring knowledge of or any modifications on the underlying network code. In fact, even a randomized network code can be used. Our approach is based on Rouayheb-Soljanin's formulation of a wiretap network as a generalization of the Ozarow-Wyner wiretap channel of type II. Essentially, the linear MDS code in Ozarow-Wyner's coset coding scheme is replaced by a maximum-rank-distance code over an extension of the field in which linear network coding operations are performed.\",\n",

We propose an algorithm to maximize the instantaneous sum data rate transmitted by a base station in the downlink of a multiuser multiple-input, multiple-output system. The transmitter and the receivers may each be equipped with multiple antennas and each user may receive more than one data stream. We show that maximizing the sum rate is closely linked to minimizing the product of mean squared errors (PMSE). The algorithm employs an uplink/downlink duality to iteratively design transmit-receive linear precoders, decoders, and power allocations that minimize the PMSE for all data streams under a sum power constraint. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and support the use of the PMSE criterion in maximizing the overall instantaneous data rate.',\n",

It is well known that an arbitrary graphical model of statistical inference defined on a tree, i.e. on a graph without loops, is solved exactly and efficiently by an iterative Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm convergent to unique minimum of the so-called Bethe free energy functional. For a general graphical model on a loopy graph the functional may show multiple minima, the iterative BP algorithm may converge to one of the minima or may not converge at all, and the global minimum of the Bethe free energy functional is not guaranteed to correspond to the optimal Maximum-Likelihood (ML) solution in the zero-temperature limit. However, there are exceptions to this general rule, discussed in \\\\cite{05KW} and \\\\cite{08BSS} in two different contexts, where zero-temperature version of the BP algorithm finds ML solution for special models on graphs with loops. These two models share a key feature: their ML solutions can be found by an efficient Linear Programming (LP) algorithm with a Totally-Uni-Modular (TUM) matrix of constraints. Generalizing the two models we consider a class of graphical models reducible in the zero temperature limit to LP with TUM constraints. Assuming that a gedanken algorithm, g-BP, funding the global minimum of the Bethe free energy is available we show that in the limit of zero temperature g-BP outputs the ML solution. Our consideration is based on equivalence established between gapless Linear Programming (LP) relaxation of the graphical model in the $T\\\\to 0$ limit and respective LP version of the Bethe-Free energy minimization.',\n",

The classical problem of reliable point-to-point digital communication is to achieve a low probability of error while keeping the rate high and the total power consumption small. Traditional information-theoretic analysis uses `waterfall\\' curves to convey the revolutionary idea that unboundedly low probabilities of bit-error are attainable using only finite transmit power. However, practitioners have long observed that the decoder complexity, and hence the total power consumption, goes up when attempting to use sophisticated codes that operate close to the waterfall curve.   This paper gives an explicit model for power consumption at an idealized decoder that allows for extreme parallelism in implementation. The decoder architecture is in the spirit of message passing and iterative decoding for sparse-graph codes. Generalized sphere-packing arguments are used to derive lower bounds on the decoding power needed for any possible code given only the gap from the Shannon limit and the desired probability of error. As the gap goes to zero, the energy per bit spent in decoding is shown to go to infinity. This suggests that to optimize total power, the transmitter should operate at a power that is strictly above the minimum demanded by the Shannon capacity.   The lower bound is plotted to show an unavoidable tradeoff between the average bit-error probability and the total power used in transmission and decoding. In the spirit of conventional waterfall curves, we call these `waterslide\\' curves.',\n",

The derived relations allow to better understanding the capacity of non-coherent channels at low SNR and bring an analytical answer to the peculiar behavior of the optimal input distribution observed in a previous work by Abou Faycal, Trott and Shamai. Then, we compute the non-coherence penalty and give a more precise characterization of the sub-linear term in SNR.

A two-terminal interactive distributed source coding problem with alternating messages for function computation at both locations is studied. For any number of messages, a computable characterization of the rate region is provided in terms of single-letter information measures. While interaction is useless in terms of the minimum sum-rate for lossless source reproduction at one or both locations, the gains can be arbitrarily large for function computation even when the sources are independent. For a class of sources and functions, interaction is shown to be useless, even with infinite messages, when a function has to be computed at only one location, but is shown to be useful, if functions have to be computed at both locations. For computing the Boolean AND function of two independent Bernoulli sources at both locations, an achievable infinite-message sum-rate with infinitesimal-rate messages is derived in terms of a two-dimensional definite integral and a rate-allocation curve. A general framework for multiterminal interactive function computation based on an information exchange protocol which successively switches among different distributed source coding configurations is developed. For networks with a star topology, multiple rounds of interactive coding is shown to decrease the scaling law of the total network rate by an order of magnitude as the network grows.',\n",

Determining the ultimate classical information carrying capacity of electromagnetic waves requires quantum-mechanical analysis to properly account for the bosonic nature of these waves. Recent work has established capacity theorems for bosonic single-user and broadcast channels, under the presumption of two minimum output entropy conjectures. Despite considerable accumulated evidence that supports the validity of these conjectures, they have yet to be proven. In this paper, it is shown that the second conjecture suffices to prove the classical capacity of the bosonic wiretap channel, which in turn would also prove the quantum capacity of the lossy bosonic channel. The preceding minimum output entropy conjectures are then shown to be simple consequences of an Entropy Photon-Number Inequality (EPnI), which is a conjectured quantum-mechanical analog of the Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) form classical information theory.',\n",

The first network consists of $n$ randomly distributed \\\\emph{primary users}, which form either an ad hoc network, or an infrastructure-supported ad hoc network with $l$ additional base stations. The second network consists of $m$ randomly distributed, ad hoc secondary users or cognitive users. The primary users have priority access to the spectrum and do not need to change their communication protocol in the presence of secondary users. The secondary users, however, need to adjust their protocol based on knowledge about the locations of the primary nodes to bring little loss to the primary network's throughput. By introducing preservation regions around primary receivers and avoidance regions around primary base stations, we propose two modified multihop routing protocols for the cognitive users. Base on percolation theory, we show that when the secondary network is denser than the primary network, both networks can simultaneously achieve the same throughput scaling law as a stand-alone network. Furthermore, the primary network throughput is subject to only a vanishingly fractional loss. Specifically, for the ad hoc and the infrastructure-supported primary models, the primary network achieves sum throughputs of order $n^{1/2}$ and $\\\\max\\\\{n^{1/2},l\\\\}$, respectively.

Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form expression for the first-order Taylor series expansion of capacity in the limit of infinite bandwidth. From this expression, we conclude that in the wideband regime: (i) it is optimal to use only one transmit antenna when the channel is spatially uncorrelated; (ii) rank-one statistical beamforming is optimal if the channel is spatially correlated; and (iii) spatial correlation, be it at the transmitter, the receiver, or both, is beneficial.\",\n",

These words encompass the well-known episturmian words, originally introduced by the second author together with X. Droubay and G. Pirillo in 2001. Other examples of rich words have appeared in many different contexts. Here we present the first unified approach to the study of this intriguing family of words.   Amongst our main results, we give an explicit description of the periodic rich infinite words and show that the recurrent balanced rich infinite words coincide with the balanced episturmian words. We also consider two wider classes of infinite words, namely \"weakly rich words\" and almost rich words (both strictly contain all rich words, but neither one is contained in the other).

Computational modelling with multi-agent systems is becoming an important technique of studying language evolution. We present a brief introduction into this rapidly developing field, as well as our own contributions that include an analysis of the evolutionary naming-game model. In this model communicating agents, that try to establish a common vocabulary, are equipped with an evolutionarily selected learning ability. Such a coupling of biological and linguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a small change of the model control parameter a poorly communicating group of linguistically unskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating group with large learning abilities. Genetic imprinting of the learning abilities proceeds via Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents learn a language and that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary pressure for the increase of learning ability. Under the assumption that communication intensity increases continuously with finite speed, the transition is split into several transition-like changes. It shows that the speed of cultural changes, that sets an additional characteristic timescale, might be yet another factor affecting the evolution of language.

We propose a planarity-preserving transformation that allows to incorporate vertex removals and vertex capacities in pseudo-polynomial interdiction algorithms for planar graphs. Additionally, a pseudo-polynomial algorithm is introduced for the problem of determining the minimal interdiction budget which is at least needed to make it impossible to satisfy the demand of all sink nodes, on planar networks with multiple sources and sinks satisfying that the sum of the supplies at the source nodes equals the sum of the demands at the sink nodes. Furthermore we show that the k-densest subgraph problem on planar graphs can be reduced to a network flow interdiction problem on a planar graph with multiple sources and sinks and polynomially bounded input numbers. However it is still not known if either of these problems can be solved in polynomial time.',\n",

              " \"Minimum Leaf Out-branching and Related Problems.  Given a digraph $D$, the Minimum Leaf Out-Branching problem (MinLOB) is the problem of finding in $D$ an out-branching with the minimum possible number of leaves, i.e., vertices of out-degree 0. We prove that MinLOB is polynomial-time solvable for acyclic digraphs. In general, MinLOB is NP-hard and we consider three parameterizations of MinLOB. We prove that two of them are NP-complete for every value of the parameter, but the third one is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). The FPT parametrization is as follows: given a digraph $D$ of order $n$ and a positive integral parameter $k$, check whether $D$ contains an out-branching with at most $n-k$ leaves (and find such an out-branching if it exists). We find a problem kernel of order $O(k^2)$ and construct an algorithm of running time $O(2^{O(k\\\\log k)}+n^6),$ which is an `additive' FPT algorithm. We also consider transformations from two related problems, the minimum path covering and the maximum internal out-tree problems into MinLOB, which imply that some parameterizations of the two problems are FPT as well.\",\n",

This article presents a study that compares detected structural communities in a coauthorship network to the socioacademic characteristics of the scholars that compose the network. The coauthorship network was created from the bibliographic record of a multi-institution, interdisciplinary research group focused on the study of sensor networks and wireless communication. Four different community detection algorithms were employed to assign a structural community to each scholar in the network: leading eigenvector, walktrap, edge betweenness and spinglass. Socioacademic characteristics were gathered from the scholars and include such information as their academic department, academic affiliation, country of origin, and academic position. A Pearson's $\\\\chi^2$ test, with a simulated Monte Carlo, revealed that structural communities best represent groupings of individuals working in the same academic department and at the same institution. A generalization of this result suggests that, even in interdisciplinary, multi-institutional research groups, coauthorship is primarily driven by departmental and institutional affiliation.\",\n",
              " \"Design and Analysis of LDGM-Based Codes for MSE Quantization.  Approaching the 1.5329-dB shaping (granular) gain limit in mean-squared error (MSE) quantization of R^n is important in a number of problems, notably dirty-paper coding. For this purpose, we start with a binary low-density generator-matrix (LDGM) code, and construct the quantization codebook by periodically repeating its set of binary codewords, or them mapped to m-ary ones with Gray mapping. The quantization algorithm is based on belief propagation, and it uses a decimation procedure to do the guessing necessary for convergence. Using the results of a true typical decimator (TTD) as reference, it is shown that the asymptotic performance of the proposed quantizer can be characterized by certain monotonicity conditions on the code's fixed point properties, which can be analyzed with density evolution, and degree distribution optimization can be carried out accordingly. When the number of iterations is finite, the resulting loss is made amenable to analysis through the introduction of a recovery algorithm from ``bad'' guesses, and the results of such analysis enable further optimization of the pace of decimation and the degree distribution. Simulation results show that the proposed LDGM-based quantizer can achieve a shaping gain of 1.4906 dB, or 0.0423 dB from the limit, and significantly outperforms trellis-coded quantization (TCQ) at a similar computational complexity.\",\n",

This paper considers the maximization of information rates for the Gaussian frequency-selective interference channel, subject to power and spectral mask constraints on each link. To derive decentralized solutions that do not require any cooperation among the users, the optimization problem is formulated as a static noncooperative game of complete information. To achieve the so-called Nash equilibria of the game, we propose a new distributed algorithm called asynchronous iterative waterfilling algorithm. In this algorithm, the users update their power spectral density in a completely distributed and asynchronous way: some users may update their power allocation more frequently than others and they may even use outdated measurements of the received interference. The proposed algorithm represents a unified framework that encompasses and generalizes all known iterative waterfilling algorithms, e.g., sequential and simultaneous versions. The main result of the paper consists of a unified set of conditions that guarantee the global converge of the proposed algorithm to the (unique) Nash equilibrium of the game.',\n",

              " \"Coding and Decoding for the Dynamic Decode and Forward Relay Protocol.  We study the Dynamic Decode and Forward (DDF) protocol for a single half-duplex relay, single-antenna channel with quasi-static fading. The DDF protocol is well-known and has been analyzed in terms of the Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) in the infinite block length limit. We characterize the finite block length DMT and give new explicit code constructions. The finite block length analysis illuminates a few key aspects that have been neglected in the previous literature: 1) we show that one dominating cause of degradation with respect to the infinite block length regime is the event of decoding error at the relay; 2) we explicitly take into account the fact that the destination does not generally know a priori the relay decision time at which the relay switches from listening to transmit mode. Both the above problems can be tackled by a careful design of the decoding algorithm. In particular, we introduce a decision rejection criterion at the relay based on Forney's decision rule (a variant of the Neyman-Pearson rule), such that the relay triggers transmission only when its decision is reliable. Also, we show that a receiver based on the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test rule that jointly decodes the relay decision time and the information message achieves the optimal DMT. Our results show that no cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for error detection or additional protocol overhead to communicate the decision time are needed for DDF. Finally, we investigate the use of minimum mean squared error generalized decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-GDFE) lattice decoding at both the relay and the destination, and show that it provides near optimal performance at moderate complexity.\",\n",

The first presents an overview of known results in statistical mechanics of disordered systems and its approach to random combinatorial optimization problems. The second part is a discussion of two original results.   The first result concerns DPLL heuristics for random k-XORSAT, which is equivalent to the diluted Ising p-spin model. It is well known that DPLL is unable to find the ground states in the clustered phase of the problem, i.e. that it leads to contradictions with probability 1. However, no solid argument supports this is general. A class of heuristics, which includes the well known UC and GUC, is introduced and studied. It is shown that any heuristic in this class must fail if the clause to variable ratio is larger than some constant, which depends on the heuristic but is always smaller than the clustering threshold.   The second result concerns the properties of random k-SAT at large clause to variable ratios. In this regime, it is well known that the uniform distribution of random instances is dominated by unsatisfiable instances. A general technique (based on the Replica method) to restrict the distribution to satisfiable instances with uniform weight is introduced, and is used to characterize their solutions. It is found that in the limit of large clause to variable ratios, the uniform distribution of satisfiable random k-SAT formulas is asymptotically equal to the much studied Planted distribution.   Both results are already published and available as arXiv:0709.0367 and arXiv:cs/0609101 . A more detailed and self-contained derivation is presented here.',\n",

These non-equilibrium solutions belong to the most probable unfrozen clusters.',\n",

Multimode precoding, where the number of independent data-streams is adapted optimally, can be used to maximize the achievable throughput in multi-antenna communication systems. Motivated by standardization efforts embraced by the industry, the focus of this work is on systematic precoder design with realistic assumptions on the spatial correlation, channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver, and implementation complexity. For spatial correlation of the channel matrix, we assume a general channel model, based on physical principles, that has been verified by many recent measurement campaigns. We also assume a coherent receiver and knowledge of the spatial statistics at the transmitter along with the presence of an ideal, low-rate feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter. The reverse link is used for codebook-index feedback and the goal of this work is to construct precoder codebooks, adaptable in response to the statistical information, such that the achievable throughput is significantly enhanced over that of a fixed, non-adaptive, i.i.d. codebook design. We illustrate how a codebook of semiunitary precoder matrices localized around some fixed center on the Grassmann manifold can be skewed in response to the spatial correlation via low-complexity maps that can rotate and scale submanifolds on the Grassmann manifold. The skewed codebook in combination with a lowcomplexity statistical power allocation scheme is then shown to bridge the gap in performance between a perfect CSI benchmark and an i.i.d. codebook design.',\n",

              " 'A path following algorithm for the graph matching problem.  We propose a convex-concave programming approach for the labeled weighted graph matching problem. The convex-concave programming formulation is obtained by rewriting the weighted graph matching problem as a least-square problem on the set of permutation matrices and relaxing it to two different optimization problems: a quadratic convex and a quadratic concave optimization problem on the set of doubly stochastic matrices. The concave relaxation has the same global minimum as the initial graph matching problem, but the search for its global minimum is also a hard combinatorial problem. We therefore construct an approximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a convex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and concave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows to easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the optimization problem, and therefore to perform labeled weighted graph matching. The algorithm is compared with some of the best performing graph matching methods on four datasets: simulated graphs, QAPLib, retina vessel images and handwritten chinese characters. In all cases, the results are competitive with the state-of-the-art.',\n",

We consider the problem of self-healing in networks that are reconfigurable in the sense that they can change their topology during an attack. Our goal is to maintain connectivity in these networks, even in the presence of repeated adversarial node deletion, by carefully adding edges after each attack. We present a new algorithm, DASH, that provably ensures that: 1) the network stays connected even if an adversary deletes up to all nodes in the network; and 2) no node ever increases its degree by more than 2 log n, where n is the number of nodes initially in the network. DASH is fully distributed; adds new edges only among neighbors of deleted nodes; and has average latency and bandwidth costs that are at most logarithmic in n. DASH has these properties irrespective of the topology of the initial network, and is thus orthogonal and complementary to traditional topology-based approaches to defending against attack.   We also prove lower-bounds showing that DASH is asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing maximum degree increase over multiple attacks. Finally, we present empirical results on power-law graphs that show that DASH performs well in practice, and that it significantly outperforms naive algorithms in reducing maximum degree increase. We also present empirical results on performance of our algorithms and a new heuristic with regard to stretch (increase in shortest path lengths).',\n",

This paper studies fingerprinting (traitor tracing) games in which the number of colluders and the collusion channel are unknown. The fingerprints are embedded into host sequences representing signals to be protected and provide the receiver with the capability to trace back pirated copies to the colluders. The colluders and the fingerprint embedder are subject to signal fidelity constraints. Our problem setup unifies the signal-distortion and Boneh-Shaw formulations of fingerprinting. The fundamental tradeoffs between fingerprint codelength, number of users, number of colluders, fidelity constraints, and decoding reliability are then determined. Several bounds on fingerprinting capacity have been presented in recent literature. This paper derives exact capacity formulas and presents a new randomized fingerprinting scheme with the following properties: (1) the encoder and receiver assume a nominal coalition size but do not need to know the actual coalition size and the collusion channel; (2) a tunable parameter $\\\\Delta$ trades off false-positive and false-negative error exponents; (3) the receiver provides a reliability metric for its decision; and (4) the scheme is capacity-achieving when the false-positive exponent $\\\\Delta$ tends to zero and the nominal coalition size coincides with the actual coalition size.   A fundamental component of the new scheme is the use of a \"time-sharing\" randomized sequence. The decoder is a maximum penalized mutual information decoder, where the significance of each candidate coalition is assessed relative to a threshold, and the penalty is proportional to the coalition size. A much simpler {\\\\em threshold decoder} that satisfies properties (1)---(3) above but not (4) is also given.',\n",

This paper considers the requirements to ensure bounded mean queuing delay and non-starvation in a slotted Aloha network operating the exponential backoff protocol. It is well-known that the maximum possible throughput of a slotted Aloha system with a large number of nodes is 1/e = 0.3679. Indeed, a saturation throughput of 1/e can be achieved with an exponential backoff factor of r = e/(e-1)=1.5820. The binary backoff factor of r = 2 is assumed in the majority of prior work, and in many practical multiple-access networks such as the Ethernet and WiFi. For slotted Aloha, the saturation throughput 0.3466 for r = 2 is reasonably close to the maximum of 1/e, and one could hardly raise objection to adopting r = 2 in the system. However, this paper shows that if mean queuing delay is to be bounded, then the sustainable throughput when r = 2 is only 0.2158, a drastic 41% drop from 1/e . Fortunately, the optimal setting of r = 1.3757 under the bounded mean-delay requirement allows us to achieve sustainable throughput of 0.3545, a penalty of only less than 4% relative to 1/e. A general conclusion is that the value of r may significantly affect the queuing delay performance. Besides analyzing mean queuing delay, this paper also delves into the phenomenon of starvation, wherein some nodes are deprived of service for an extended period of time while other nodes hog the system. Specifically, we propose a quantitative definition for starvation and show that the conditions to guarantee bounded mean delay and non-starved operation are one of the same, thus uniting these two notions. Finally, we show that when mean delay is large and starvation occurs, the performance results obtained from simulation experiments may not converge. A quantitative discussion of this issue is provided in this paper.',\n",

Conventional Non-Linear Feedback Shift Registers (NLFSRs) use the Fibonacci configuration in which the value of the first bit is updated according to some non-linear feedback function of previous values of other bits, and each remaining bit repeats the value of its previous bit. We show how to transform the feedback function of a Fibonacci NLFSR into several smaller feedback functions of individual bits. Such a transformation reduces the propagation time, thus increasing the speed of pseudo-random sequence generation.

              " 'Scaling Laws and Techniques in Decentralized Processing of Interfered   Gaussian Channels.  The scaling laws of the achievable communication rates and the corresponding upper bounds of distributed reception in the presence of an interfering signal are investigated. The scheme includes one transmitter communicating to a remote destination via two relays, which forward messages to the remote destination through reliable links with finite capacities. The relays receive the transmission along with some unknown interference. We focus on three common settings for distributed reception, wherein the scaling laws of the capacity (the pre-log as the power of the transmitter and the interference are taken to infinity) are completely characterized. It is shown in most cases that in order to overcome the interference, a definite amount of information about the interference needs to be forwarded along with the desired message, to the destination. It is exemplified in one scenario that the cut-set upper bound is strictly loose. The results are derived using the cut-set along with a new bounding technique, which relies on multi letter expressions. Furthermore, lattices are found to be a useful communication technique in this setting, and are used to characterize the scaling laws of achievable rates.',\n",

              " \"A Neyman-Pearson Approach to Universal Erasure and List Decoding.  When information is to be transmitted over an unknown, possibly unreliable channel, an erasure option at the decoder is desirable. Using constant-composition random codes, we propose a generalization of Csiszar and Korner's Maximum Mutual Information decoder with erasure option for discrete memoryless channels. The new decoder is parameterized by a weighting function that is designed to optimize the fundamental tradeoff between undetected-error and erasure exponents for a compound class of channels. The class of weighting functions may be further enlarged to optimize a similar tradeoff for list decoders -- in that case, undetected-error probability is replaced with average number of incorrect messages in the list. Explicit solutions are identified.   The optimal exponents admit simple expressions in terms of the sphere-packing exponent, at all rates below capacity. For small erasure exponents, these expressions coincide with those derived by Forney (1968) for symmetric channels, using Maximum a Posteriori decoding. Thus for those channels at least, ignorance of the channel law is inconsequential. Conditions for optimality of the Csiszar-Korner rule and of the simpler empirical-mutual-information thresholding rule are identified. The error exponents are evaluated numerically for the binary symmetric channel.\",\n",

Given a set of leaf-labeled trees with identical leaf sets, the well-known \"Maximum Agreement SubTree\" problem (MAST) consists of finding a subtree homeomorphically included in all input trees and with the largest number of leaves. Its variant called \"Maximum Compatible Tree\" (MCT) is less stringent, as it allows the input trees to be refined. Both problems are of particular interest in computational biology, where trees encountered have often small degrees.   In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of MAST and MCT with respect to the maximum degree, denoted by D, of the input trees. It is known that MAST is polynomial for bounded D. As a counterpart, we show that the problem is W[1]-hard with respect to parameter D. Moreover, relying on recent advances in parameterized complexity we obtain a tight lower bound: while MAST can be solved in O(N^{O(D)}) time where N denotes the input length, we show that an O(N^{o(D)}) bound is not achievable, unless SNP is contained in SE. We also show that MCT is W[1]-hard with respect to D, and that MCT cannot be solved in O(N^{o(2^{D/2})}) time, SNP is contained in SE.',\n",

In this paper, we address the problem of PLE estimation in large wireless networks, which is relevant to several important issues in networked communications such as localization, energy-efficient routing, and channel access. We consider a large ad hoc network where nodes are distributed as a homogeneous Poisson point process on the plane and the channels are subject to Nakagami-m fading. We propose and discuss three distributed algorithms for estimating the PLE under these settings which explicitly take into account the interference in the network. In addition, we provide simulation results to demonstrate the performance of the algorithms and quantify the estimation errors. We also describe how to estimate the PLE accurately even in networks with spatially varying PLEs and more general node distributions.',\n",

Independence is well-understood in classical information theory, but less in algorithmic information theory. Working in the framework of algorithmic information theory, the paper proposes two types of independence for arbitrary infinite binary sequences and studies their properties. Our two proposed notions of independence have some of the intuitive properties that one naturally expects. For example, for every sequence $x$, the set of sequences that are independent (in the weaker of the two senses) with $x$ has measure one. For both notions of independence we investigate to what extent pairs of independent sequences, can be effectively constructed via Turing reductions (from one or more input sequences). In this respect, we prove several impossibility results. For example, it is shown that there is no effective way of producing from an arbitrary sequence with positive constructive Hausdorff dimension two sequences that are independent (even in the weaker type of independence) and have super-logarithmic complexity. Finally, a few conjectures and open questions are discussed.',\n",

Recent work has characterized the sum capacity of time-varying/frequency-selective wireless interference networks and $X$ networks within $o(\\\\log({SNR}))$, i.e., with an accuracy approaching 100% at high SNR (signal to noise power ratio). In this paper, we seek similar capacity characterizations for wireless networks with relays, feedback, full duplex operation, and transmitter/receiver cooperation through noisy channels. First, we consider a network with $S$ source nodes, $R$ relay nodes and $D$ destination nodes with random time-varying/frequency-selective channel coefficients and global channel knowledge at all nodes. We allow full-duplex operation at all nodes, as well as causal noise-free feedback of all received signals to all source and relay nodes. The sum capacity of this network is characterized as $\\\\frac{SD}{S+D-1}\\\\log({SNR})+o(\\\\log({SNR}))$. The implication of the result is that the capacity benefits of relays, causal feedback, transmitter/receiver cooperation through physical channels and full duplex operation become a negligible fraction of the network capacity at high SNR. Some exceptions to this result are also pointed out in the paper. Second, we consider a network with $K$ full duplex nodes with an independent message from every node to every other node in the network.

              " 'Combining generic judgments with recursive definitions.  Many semantical aspects of programming languages, such as their operational semantics and their type assignment calculi, are specified by describing appropriate proof systems. Recent research has identified two proof-theoretic features that allow direct, logic-based reasoning about such descriptions: the treatment of atomic judgments as fixed points (recursive definitions) and an encoding of binding constructs via generic judgments. However, the logics encompassing these two features have thus far treated them orthogonally: that is, they do not provide the ability to define object-logic properties that themselves depend on an intrinsic treatment of binding. We propose a new and simple integration of these features within an intuitionistic logic enhanced with induction over natural numbers and we show that the resulting logic is consistent. The pivotal benefit of the integration is that it allows recursive definitions to not just encode simple, traditional forms of atomic judgments but also to capture generic properties pertaining to such judgments. The usefulness of this logic is illustrated by showing how it can provide elegant treatments of object-logic contexts that appear in proofs involving typing calculi and of arbitrarily cascading substitutions that play a role in reducibility arguments.',\n",

Similar models apply to a broad range of computational phenomena, arising in networks of computers, as well as in genetic, and neural nets, in social networks, and so on. The main problem of interaction with such spontaneously evolving computational systems is that the data are not uniformly structured. An interesting approach is to try to extract the semantical content of the data from their distribution among the nodes. A concept is then identified by finding the community of nodes that share it. The task of data structuring is thus reduced to the task of finding the network communities, as groups of nodes that together perform some non-local data processing. Towards this goal, we extend the ranking methods from nodes to paths. This allows us to extract some information about the likely flow biases from the available static information about the network.',\n",

This paper deals with a coding problem called complementary delivery, where messages from two correlated sources are jointly encoded and each decoder reproduces one of two messages using the other message as the side information. Both lossless and lossy universal complementary delivery coding schemes are investigated. In the lossless case, it is demonstrated that a universal complementary delivery code can be constructed by only combining two Slepian-Wolf codes. Especially, it is shown that a universal lossless complementary delivery code, for which error probability is exponentially tight, can be constructed from two linear Slepian-Wolf codes. In the lossy case, a universal complementary delivery coding scheme based on Wyner-Ziv codes is proposed. While the proposed scheme cannot attain the optimal rate-distortion trade-off in general, the rate-loss is upper bounded by a universal constant under some mild conditions. The proposed schemes allows us to apply any Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv codes to complementary delivery coding.',\n",

We consider single-source single-sink (ss-ss) multi-hop networks, with slow-fading links and single-antenna half-duplex relays. We identify two families of networks that are multi-hop generalizations of the well-studied two-hop network: K-Parallel-Path (KPP) networks and layered networks. KPP networks can be viewed as the union of K node-disjoint parallel relaying paths, each of length greater than one. KPP networks are then generalized to KPP(I) networks, which permit interference between paths and to KPP(D) networks, which possess a direct link from source to sink. We characterize the DMT of these families of networks completely for K > 3. Layered networks are networks comprising of relaying layers with edges existing only within the same layer or between adjacent layers. We prove that a linear DMT between the maximum diversity d_{max} and the maximum multiplexing gain of 1 is achievable for fully-connected layered networks. This is shown to be equal to the optimal DMT if the number of layers is less than 4. For multi-antenna KPP and layered networks, we provide an achievable DMT region.   For arbitrary ss-ss single-antenna directed-acyclic full-duplex networks, we prove that a linear tradeoff between maximum diversity and maximum multiplexing gain is achievable. All protocols in this paper are explicit and use only amplify and forward (AF) relaying. We also construct codes with short block-lengths based on cyclic division algebras that achieve the optimal DMT for all the proposed schemes. Two key implications of the results in the paper are that the half-duplex constraint does not entail any rate loss for a large class of networks and that simple AF protocols are often sufficient to attain the optimal DMT.',\n",

Wireless fading networks with multiple antennas are typically studied information-theoretically from two different perspectives - the outage characterization and the ergodic capacity characterization. A key parameter in the outage characterization of a network is the diversity, whereas a first-order indicator for the ergodic capacity is the degrees of freedom (DOF), which is the pre-log coefficient in the capacity expression. In this paper, we present max-flow min-cut type theorems for computing both the diversity and the degrees of freedom of arbitrary single-source single-sink multi-antenna networks. We also show that an amplify-and-forward protocol is sufficient to achieve this. The degrees of freedom characterization is obtained using a conversion to a deterministic wireless network for which the capacity was recently found. We show that the diversity result easily extends to multi-source multi-sink networks and evaluate the DOF for multi-casting in single-source multi-sink networks.',\n",

The cost function is a direct result of a new characterization of well-centeredness in arbitrary dimensions that we present. Ours is the first optimization-based heuristic for well-centeredness, and the first one that applies in both two and three dimensions. We show the results of applying our algorithm to small and large two-dimensional meshes, some with a complex boundary, and obtain a well-centered tetrahedralization of the cube.

Given a ground set V and a collection of subsets S_i of V, a feasible solution is a partition of V such that each subset of the partition is included in one of the S_i. The problem involves maximizing the mean subset size of the partition, where the mean is the generalized mean of parameter p, taken over the elements. For p=-1, the problem is equivalent to the classical minimum set cover problem. For p=0, it is equivalent to the minimum entropy set cover problem, introduced by Halperin and Karp. For p=1, the problem includes the maximum-edge clique partition problem as a special case. We prove that the greedy algorithm simultaneously approximates the problem within a factor of (p+1)^1/p for any p in R^+, and that this is the best possible unless P=NP. These results both generalize and simplify previous results for special cases. We also consider the corresponding graph coloring problem, and prove several tractability and inapproximability results. Finally, we consider a further generalization of the set cover problem in which we aim at minimizing the sum of some concave function of the part sizes.

For example, counting the pth frequency moment has been a very active area of research, in theoretical computer science, databases, and data mining. When p=1, the task (i.e., counting the sum) can be accomplished using a simple counter.   Compressed Counting (CC) is proposed for efficiently computing the pth frequency moment of a data stream signal A_t, where 0<p<=2. CC is applicable if the streaming data follow the Turnstile model, with the restriction that at the time t for the evaluation, A_t[i]>= 0, which includes the strict Turnstile model as a special case. For natural data streams encountered in practice, this restriction is minor.   The underly technique for CC is what we call skewed stable random projections, which captures the intuition that, when p=1 a simple counter suffices, and when p = 1+/\\\\Delta with small \\\\Delta, the sample complexity of a counter system should be low (continuously as a function of \\\\Delta).

              " 'Design by Measure and Conquer, A Faster Exact Algorithm for Dominating   Set.  The measure and conquer approach has proven to be a powerful tool to analyse exact algorithms for combinatorial problems, like Dominating Set and Independent Set. In this paper, we propose to use measure and conquer also as a tool in the design of algorithms. In an iterative process, we can obtain a series of branch and reduce algorithms. A mathematical analysis of an algorithm in the series with measure and conquer results in a quasiconvex programming problem. The solution by computer to this problem not only gives a bound on the running time, but also can give a new reduction rule, thus giving a new, possibly faster algorithm. This makes design by measure and conquer a form of computer aided algorithm design. When we apply the methodology to a Set Cover modelling of the Dominating Set problem, we obtain the currently fastest known exact algorithms for Dominating Set: an algorithm that uses $O(1.5134^n)$ time and polynomial space, and an algorithm that uses $O(1.5063^n)$ time.',\n",

The purpose of this paper is to provide efficient algorithms that decide membership for classes of several Boolean hierarchies for which efficiency (or even decidability) were previously not known. We develop new forbidden-chain characterizations for the single levels of these hierarchies and obtain the following results: - The classes of the Boolean hierarchy over level $\\\\Sigma_1$ of the dot-depth hierarchy are decidable in $NL$ (previously only the decidability was known). The same remains true if predicates mod $d$ for fixed $d$ are allowed. - If modular predicates for arbitrary $d$ are allowed, then the classes of the Boolean hierarchy over level $\\\\Sigma_1$ are decidable. - For the restricted case of a two-letter alphabet, the classes of the Boolean hierarchy over level $\\\\Sigma_2$ of the Straubing-Th\\\\'erien hierarchy are decidable in $NL$.

Disjunctive Logic Programming (DLP) is a very expressive formalism: it allows for expressing every property of finite structures that is decidable in the complexity class SigmaP2 (= NP^NP). Despite this high expressiveness, there are some simple properties, often arising in real-world applications, which cannot be encoded in a simple and natural manner. Especially properties that require the use of arithmetic operators (like sum, times, or count) on a set or multiset of elements, which satisfy some conditions, cannot be naturally expressed in classic DLP.   To overcome this deficiency, we extend DLP by aggregate functions in a conservative way. In particular, we avoid the introduction of constructs with disputed semantics, by requiring aggregates to be stratified. We formally define the semantics of the extended language (called DLP^A), and illustrate how it can be profitably used for representing knowledge. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity of DLP^A, showing that the addition of aggregates does not bring a higher cost in that respect. Finally, we provide an implementation of DLP^A in DLV -- a state-of-the-art DLP system -- and report on experiments which confirm the usefulness of the proposed extension also for the efficiency of computation.',\n",

They can be computed efficiently for many representations of the data including distributed databases and data streams.   We derive novel unbiased estimators and efficient confidence bounds for subpopulation weight. Our estimators and bounds are tailored by distinguishing between applications (such as data streams) where the total weight of the sketched set can be computed by the summarization algorithm without a significant use of additional resources, and applications (such as sketches of network neighborhoods) where this is not the case.   Our rigorous derivations are based on clever applications of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, and are complemented by efficient computational methods.

In this paper, we develop new, improved outer bounds on the capacity region. Using these bounds, we show that treating interference as noise achieves the sum capacity of the two user Gaussian interference channel in a low interference regime, where the interference parameters are below certain thresholds.

We introduce a stochastic approximation version extending DILOC to random environments when the knowledge about the intercommunications among sensors and the inter-sensor distances are noisy, and the communication links among neighbors fail at random times.

A survey is given summarizing the state of the art of describing information processing in Quantum Decision Theory, which has been recently advanced as a novel variant of decision making, based on the mathematical theory of separable Hilbert spaces. This mathematical structure captures the effect of superposition of composite prospects, including many incorporated intended actions. The theory characterizes entangled decision making, non-commutativity of subsequent decisions, and intention interference. The self-consistent procedure of decision making, in the frame of the quantum decision theory, takes into account both the available objective information as well as subjective contextual effects. This quantum approach avoids any paradox typical of classical decision theory. Conditional maximization of entropy, equivalent to the minimization of an information functional, makes it possible to connect the quantum and classical decision theories, showing that the latter is the limit of the former under vanishing interference terms.',\n",

Thus, the truncated series can be easily re-summed, using the Pfaffian formula of Kasteleyn [4]. This allows to identify a big class of computationally tractable planar models reducible to a dimer model via the Belief Propagation (gauge) transformation. The Pfaffian representation can also be extended to the full Loop Series, in which case the expansion becomes a sum of Pfaffian contributions, each associated with dimer matchings on an extension to a subgraph of the original graph.

We propose a dynamical process for network evolution, aiming at explaining the emergence of the small world phenomenon, i.e., the statistical observation that any pair of individuals are linked by a short chain of acquaintances computable by a simple decentralized routing algorithm, known as greedy routing. Previously proposed dynamical processes enabled to demonstrate experimentally (by simulations) that the small world phenomenon can emerge from local dynamics. However, the analysis of greedy routing using the probability distributions arising from these dynamics is quite complex because of mutual dependencies. In contrast, our process enables complete formal analysis. It is based on the combination of two simple processes: a random walk process, and an harmonic forgetting process. Both processes reflect natural behaviors of the individuals, viewed as nodes in the network of inter-individual acquaintances. We prove that, in k-dimensional lattices, the combination of these two processes generates long-range links mutually independently distributed as a k-harmonic distribution. We analyze the performances of greedy routing at the stationary regime of our process, and prove that the expected number of steps for routing from any source to any target in any multidimensional lattice is a polylogarithmic function of the distance between the two nodes in the lattice. Up to our knowledge, these results are the first formal proof that navigability in small worlds can emerge from a dynamical process for network evolution. Our dynamical process can find practical applications to the design of spatial gossip and resource location protocols.',\n",

The decoder is a {\\\\em maximum doubly-penalized mutual information decoder}, where the significance of each candidate coalition is assessed relative to a threshold that trades off false-positive and false-negative error exponents. The penalty is proportional to coalition size and is a function of the conditional type of host sequence. Positive exponents are obtained at all rates below a certain value, which is therefore a lower bound on public fingerprinting capacity. We conjecture that this value is the public fingerprinting capacity. A simpler threshold decoder is also given, which has similar universality properties but also lower achievable rates.

We relate the resulting theory to the algebraic theory of processes known as ACP and use it to describe analytic execution architectures suited for fragmented programs. We also consider the case where the steps of fragmented program behaviours are interleaved in the ways of non-distributed and distributed multi-threading.',\n",

Language emergence and evolution has recently gained growing attention through multi-agent models and mathematical frameworks to study their behavior. Here we investigate further the Naming Game, a model able to account for the emergence of a shared vocabulary of form-meaning associations through social/cultural learning. Due to the simplicity of both the structure of the agents and their interaction rules, the dynamics of this model can be analyzed in great detail using numerical simulations and analytical arguments. This paper first reviews some existing results and then presents a new overall understanding.',\n",
              " \"The Complexity of Testing Properties of Simple Games.  Simple games cover voting systems in which a single alternative, such as a bill or an amendment, is pitted against the status quo. A simple game or a yes-no voting system is a set of rules that specifies exactly which collections of ``yea'' votes yield passage of the issue at hand. A collection of ``yea'' voters forms a winning coalition.   We are interested on performing a complexity analysis of problems on such games depending on the game representation. We consider four natural explicit representations, winning, loosing, minimal winning, and maximal loosing. We first analyze the computational complexity of obtaining a particular representation of a simple game from a different one. We show that some cases this transformation can be done in polynomial time while the others require exponential time. The second question is classifying the complexity for testing whether a game is simple or weighted. We show that for the four types of representation both problem can be solved in polynomial time. Finally, we provide results on the complexity of testing whether a simple game or a weighted game is of a special type. In this way, we analyze strongness, properness, decisiveness and homogeneity, which are desirable properties to be fulfilled for a simple game.\",\n",

Understanding the functioning of a neural system in terms of its underlying circuitry is an important problem in neuroscience. Recent developments in electrophysiology and imaging allow one to simultaneously record activities of hundreds of neurons. Inferring the underlying neuronal connectivity patterns from such multi-neuronal spike train data streams is a challenging statistical and computational problem. This task involves finding significant temporal patterns from vast amounts of symbolic time series data. In this paper we show that the frequent episode mining methods from the field of temporal data mining can be very useful in this context. In the frequent episode discovery framework, the data is viewed as a sequence of events, each of which is characterized by an event type and its time of occurrence and episodes are certain types of temporal patterns in such data. Here we show that, using the set of discovered frequent episodes from multi-neuronal data, one can infer different types of connectivity patterns in the neural system that generated it. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of mining for frequent episodes under certain temporal constraints; the structure of these temporal constraints is motivated by the application. We present algorithms for discovering serial and parallel episodes under these temporal constraints. Through extensive simulation studies we demonstrate that these methods are useful for unearthing patterns of neuronal network connectivity.',\n",

From a high volume stream of weighted items, we want to maintain a generic sample of a certain limited size $k$ that we can later use to estimate the total weight of arbitrary subsets. This is the classic context of on-line reservoir sampling, thinking of the generic sample as a reservoir. We present an efficient reservoir sampling scheme, $\\\\varoptk$, that dominates all previous schemes in terms of estimation quality.   $\\\\varoptk$ provides {\\\\em variance optimal unbiased estimation of subset sums}. More precisely, if we have seen $n$ items of the stream, then for {\\\\em any} subset size $m$, our scheme based on $k$ samples minimizes the average variance over all subsets of size $m$. In fact, the optimality is against any off-line scheme with $k$ samples tailored for the concrete set of items seen. In addition to optimal average variance, our scheme provides tighter worst-case bounds on the variance of {\\\\em particular} subsets than previously possible. It is efficient, handling each new item of the stream in $O(\\\\log k)$ time. Finally, it is particularly well suited for combination of samples from different streams in a distributed setting.',\n",

              " 'On the Approximate Eigenstructure of Time-Varying Channels.  In this article we consider the approximate description of doubly--dispersive channels by its symbol. We focus on channel operators with compactly supported spreading, which are widely used to represent fast fading multipath communication channels. The concept of approximate eigenstructure is introduced, which measures the accuracy E_p of the approximation of the channel operation as a pure multiplication in a given L_p-norm. Two variants of such an approximate Weyl symbol calculus are studied, which have important applications in several models for time--varying mobile channels. Typically, such channels have random spreading functions (inverse Weyl transform) defined on a common support U of finite non--zero size such that approximate eigenstructure has to be measured with respect to certain norms of the spreading process. We derive several explicit relations to the size |U| of the support. We show that the characterization of the ratio of E_p to some L_q-norm of the spreading function is related to weighted norms of ambiguity and Wigner functions. We present the connection to localization operators and give new bounds on the ability of localization of ambiguity functions and Wigner functions in U. Our analysis generalizes and improves recent results for the case p=2 and q=1.',\n",
              " 'Network Coding for Distributed Storage Systems.  Distributed storage systems provide reliable access to data through redundancy spread over individually unreliable nodes. Application scenarios include data centers, peer-to-peer storage systems, and storage in wireless networks. Storing data using an erasure code, in fragments spread across nodes, requires less redundancy than simple replication for the same level of reliability. However, since fragments must be periodically replaced as nodes fail, a key question is how to generate encoded fragments in a distributed way while transferring as little data as possible across the network.   For an erasure coded system, a common practice to repair from a node failure is for a new node to download subsets of data stored at a number of surviving nodes, reconstruct a lost coded block using the downloaded data, and store it at the new node. We show that this procedure is sub-optimal. We introduce the notion of regenerating codes, which allow a new node to download \\\\emph{functions} of the stored data from the surviving nodes. We show that regenerating codes can significantly reduce the repair bandwidth. Further, we show that there is a fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth which we theoretically characterize using flow arguments on an appropriately constructed graph. By invoking constructive results in network coding, we introduce regenerating codes that can achieve any point in this optimal tradeoff.',\n",

              " \"Complexity Analysis of Reed-Solomon Decoding over GF(2^m) Without Using   Syndromes.  For the majority of the applications of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, hard decision decoding is based on syndromes. Recently, there has been renewed interest in decoding RS codes without using syndromes. In this paper, we investigate the complexity of syndromeless decoding for RS codes, and compare it to that of syndrome-based decoding. Aiming to provide guidelines to practical applications, our complexity analysis differs in several aspects from existing asymptotic complexity analysis, which is typically based on multiplicative fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques and is usually in big O notation. First, we focus on RS codes over characteristic-2 fields, over which some multiplicative FFT techniques are not applicable. Secondly, due to moderate block lengths of RS codes in practice, our analysis is complete since all terms in the complexities are accounted for. Finally, in addition to fast implementation using additive FFT techniques, we also consider direct implementation, which is still relevant for RS codes with moderate lengths. Comparing the complexities of both syndromeless and syndrome-based decoding algorithms based on direct and fast implementations, we show that syndromeless decoding algorithms have higher complexities than syndrome-based ones for high rate RS codes regardless of the implementation. Both errors-only and errors-and-erasures decoding are considered in this paper. We also derive tighter bounds on the complexities of fast polynomial multiplications based on Cantor's approach and the fast extended Euclidean algorithm.\",\n",

Recently, the theory of quantum error control codes has been extended to subsystem codes over symmetric and asymmetric quantum channels -- qubit-flip and phase-shift errors may have equal or different probabilities. Previous work in constructing quantum error control codes has focused on code constructions for symmetric quantum channels. In this paper, we develop a theory and establish the connection between asymmetric quantum codes and subsystem codes. We present families of subsystem and asymmetric quantum codes derived, once again, from classical BCH and RS codes over finite fields. Particularly, we derive an interesting asymmetric and symmetric subsystem codes based on classical BCH codes with parameters $[[n,k,r,d]]_q$, $[[n,k,r,d_z/d_x]]_q$ and $[[n,k',0,d_z/d_x]]_q$ for arbitrary values of code lengths and dimensions. We establish asymmetric Singleton and Hamming bounds on asymmetric quantum and subsystem code parameters; and derive optimal asymmetric MDS subsystem codes. Finally, our constructions are well explained by an illustrative example.   This paper is written on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the discovery of classical BCH codes and their quantum counterparts were derived nearly 10 years ago.\",\n",

              " 'Incremental Topological Ordering and Strong Component Maintenance.  We present an on-line algorithm for maintaining a topological order of a directed acyclic graph as arcs are added, and detecting a cycle when one is created. Our algorithm takes O(m^{1/2}) amortized time per arc, where m is the total number of arcs. For sparse graphs, this bound improves the best previous bound by a logarithmic factor and is tight to within a constant factor for a natural class of algorithms that includes all the existing ones. Our main insight is that the bidirectional search method of previous algorithms does not require an ordered search, but can be more general. This allows us to avoid the use of heaps (priority queues) entirely. Instead, the deterministic version of our algorithm uses (approximate) median-finding. The randomized version of our algorithm avoids this complication, making it very simple. We extend our topological ordering algorithm to give the first detailed algorithm for maintaining the strong components of a directed graph, and a topological order of these components, as arcs are added. This extension also has an amortized time bound of O(m^{1/2}) per arc.',\n",

We propose a new method for reconstruction of sparse signals with and without noisy perturbations, termed the subspace pursuit algorithm. The algorithm has two important characteristics: low computational complexity, comparable to that of orthogonal matching pursuit techniques when applied to very sparse signals, and reconstruction accuracy of the same order as that of LP optimization methods. The presented analysis shows that in the noiseless setting, the proposed algorithm can exactly reconstruct arbitrary sparse signals provided that the sensing matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property with a constant parameter. In the noisy setting and in the case that the signal is not exactly sparse, it can be shown that the mean squared error of the reconstruction is upper bounded by constant multiples of the measurement and signal perturbation energies.',\n",

We prove that a wheel graph $W_n$ admits a drawing $\\\\pi$ such that, if one wants to eliminate edge crossings by shifting vertices to new positions in the plane, then at most $(2+o(1))\\\\sqrt n$ of all $n$ vertices can stay fixed. Moreover, such a drawing $\\\\pi$ exists even if it is presupposed that the vertices occupy any prescribed set of points in the plane. Similar questions are discussed for other families of planar graphs.',\n",

A generalized flow is one in which the flow out of an edge differs from the flow into the edge by a constant factor. We limit ourselves to the lossy case, when these factors are at most 1.   Our algorithm uses a standard interior-point algorithm to solve a linear program formulation of the network flow problem. The system of linear equations that arises at each step of the interior-point algorithm takes the form of a symmetric M-matrix. We present an algorithm for solving such systems in nearly linear time. The algorithm relies on the Spielman-Teng nearly linear time algorithm for solving linear systems in diagonally-dominant matrices.   For a graph with m edges, our algorithm obtains an additive epsilon approximation of the maximum generalized flow and minimum cost generalized flow in time tildeO(m^(3/2) * log(1/epsilon)). In many parameter ranges, this improves over previous algorithms by a factor of approximately m^(1/2). We also obtain a similar improvement for exactly solving the standard min-cost flow problem.',\n",

This philosophical paper explores the relation between modern scientific simulations and the future of the universe. We argue that a simulation of an entire universe will result from future scientific activity. This requires us to tackle the challenge of simulating open-ended evolution at all levels in a single simulation. The simulation should encompass not only biological evolution, but also physical evolution (a level below) and cultural evolution (a level above). The simulation would allow us to probe what would happen if we would \"replay the tape of the universe\" with the same or different laws and initial conditions. We also distinguish between real-world and artificial-world modelling. Assuming that intelligent life could indeed simulate an entire universe, this leads to two tentative hypotheses. Some authors have argued that we may already be in a simulation run by an intelligent entity. Or, if such a simulation could be made real, this would lead to the production of a new universe. This last direction is argued with a careful speculative philosophical approach, emphasizing the imperative to find a solution to the heat death problem in cosmology.

              " 'The Rate Loss of Single-Letter Characterization: The \"Dirty\" Multiple   Access Channel.  For general memoryless systems, the typical information theoretic solution - when exists - has a \"single-letter\" form. This reflects the fact that optimum performance can be approached by a random code (or a random binning scheme), generated using independent and identically distributed copies of some single-letter distribution. Is that the form of the solution of any (information theoretic) problem? In fact, some counter examples are known. The most famous is the \"two help one\" problem: Korner and Marton showed that if we want to decode the modulo-two sum of two binary sources from their independent encodings, then linear coding is better than random coding. In this paper we provide another counter example, the \"doubly-dirty\" multiple access channel (MAC). Like the Korner-Marton problem, this is a multi-terminal scenario where side information is distributed among several terminals; each transmitter knows part of the channel interference but the receiver is not aware of any part of it. We give an explicit solution for the capacity region of a binary version of the doubly-dirty MAC, demonstrate how the capacity region can be approached using a linear coding scheme, and prove that the \"best known single-letter region\" is strictly contained in it. We also state a conjecture regarding a similar rate loss of single letter characterization in the Gaussian case.',\n",

We analyze a multi-level MIMO relaying system where a multiple-antenna transmitter sends data to a multipleantenna receiver through several relay levels, also equipped with multiple antennas. Assuming correlated fading in each hop, each relay receives a faded version of the signal transmitted by the previous level, performs precoding on the received signal and retransmits it to the next level. Using free probability theory and assuming that the noise power at the relay levels - but not at the receiver - is negligible, a closed-form expression of the end-to-end asymptotic instantaneous mutual information is derived as the number of antennas in all levels grow large with the same rate. This asymptotic expression is shown to be independent from the channel realizations, to only depend on the channel statistics and to also serve as the asymptotic value of the end-to-end average mutual information. We also provide the optimal singular vectors of the precoding matrices that maximize the asymptotic mutual information : the optimal transmit directions represented by the singular vectors of the precoding matrices are aligned on the eigenvectors of the channel correlation matrices, therefore they can be determined only using the known statistics of the channel matrices and do not depend on a particular channel realization.',\n",

Robot-control designers have begun to exploit the properties of the human immune system in order to produce dynamic systems that can adapt to complex, varying, real-world tasks. Jernes idiotypic-network theory has proved the most popular artificial-immune-system (AIS) method for incorporation into behaviour-based robotics, since idiotypic selection produces highly adaptive responses. However, previous efforts have mostly focused on evolving the network connections and have often worked with a single, pre-engineered set of behaviours, limiting variability. This paper describes a method for encoding behaviours as a variable set of attributes, and shows that when the encoding is used with a genetic algorithm (GA), multiple sets of diverse behaviours can develop naturally and rapidly, providing much greater scope for flexible behaviour-selection. The algorithm is tested extensively with a simulated e-puck robot that navigates around a maze by tracking colour. Results show that highly successful behaviour sets can be generated within about 25 minutes, and that much greater diversity can be obtained when multiple autonomous populations are used, rather than a single one.',\n",

This study examines the differences between Scopus and Web of Science in the citation counting, citation ranking, and h-index of 22 top human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers from EQUATOR--a large British Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration project. Results indicate that Scopus provides significantly more coverage of HCI literature than Web of Science, primarily due to coverage of relevant ACM and IEEE peer-reviewed conference proceedings. No significant differences exist between the two databases if citations in journals only are compared. Although broader coverage of the literature does not significantly alter the relative citation ranking of individual researchers, Scopus helps distinguish between the researchers in a more nuanced fashion than Web of Science in both citation counting and h-index. Scopus also generates significantly different maps of citation networks of individual scholars than those generated by Web of Science. The study also presents a comparison of h-index scores based on Google Scholar with those based on the union of Scopus and Web of Science.

The notion of complex systems is common to many domains, from Biology to Economy, Computer Science, Physics, etc. Often, these systems are made of sets of entities moving in an evolving environment. One of their major characteristics is the emergence of some global properties stemmed from local interactions between the entities themselves and between the entities and the environment. The structure of these systems as sets of interacting entities leads researchers to model them as graphs. However, their understanding requires most often to consider the dynamics of their evolution. It is indeed not relevant to study some properties out of any temporal consideration. Thus, dynamic graphs seem to be a very suitable model for investigating the emergence and the conservation of some properties. GraphStream is a Java-based library whose main purpose is to help researchers and developers in their daily tasks of dynamic problem modeling and of classical graph management tasks: creation, processing, display, etc. It may also be used, and is indeed already used, for teaching purpose. GraphStream relies on an event-based engine allowing several event sources. Events may be included in the core of the application, read from a file or received from an event handler.',\n",

Assuming the number of targets K is small (i.e., K much less than N^2), then we can transmit a sufficiently \"incoherent\" pulse and employ the techniques of compressed sensing to reconstruct the target scene. A theoretical upper bound on the sparsity K is presented. Numerical simulations verify that even better performance can be achieved in practice.

Constant-dimension codes have recently received attention due to their significance to error control in noncoherent random linear network coding. What the maximal cardinality of any constant-dimension code with finite dimension and minimum distance is and how to construct the optimal constant-dimension code (or codes) that achieves the maximal cardinality both remain open research problems. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to solving these two problems. We first establish a connection between constant-rank codes and constant-dimension codes. Via this connection, we show that optimal constant-dimension codes correspond to optimal constant-rank codes over matrices with sufficiently many rows. As such, the two aforementioned problems are equivalent to determining the maximum cardinality of constant-rank codes and to constructing optimal constant-rank codes, respectively. To this end, we then derive bounds on the maximum cardinality of a constant-rank code with a given minimum rank distance, propose explicit constructions of optimal or asymptotically optimal constant-rank codes, and establish asymptotic bounds on the maximum rate of a constant-rank code.',\n",

Abella is an interactive system for reasoning about aspects of object languages that have been formally presented through recursive rules based on syntactic structure. Abella utilizes a two-level logic approach to specification and reasoning. One level is defined by a specification logic which supports a transparent encoding of structural semantics rules and also enables their execution. The second level, called the reasoning logic, embeds the specification logic and allows the development of proofs of properties about specifications. An important characteristic of both logics is that they exploit the lambda tree syntax approach to treating binding in object languages. Amongst other things, Abella has been used to prove normalizability properties of the lambda calculus, cut admissibility for a sequent calculus and type uniqueness and subject reduction properties. This paper discusses the logical foundations of Abella, outlines the style of theorem proving that it supports and finally describes some of its recent applications.',\n",

The three-input TOFFOLI gate is the workhorse of circuit synthesis for classical logic operations on quantum data, e.g., reversible arithmetic circuits. In physical implementations, however, TOFFOLI gates are decomposed into six CNOT gates and several one-qubit gates. Though this decomposition has been known for at least 10 years, we provide here the first demonstration of its CNOT-optimality.   We study three-qubit circuits which contain less than six CNOT gates and implement a block-diagonal operator, then show that they implicitly describe the cosine-sine decomposition of a related operator. Leveraging the canonicity of such decompositions to limit one-qubit gates appearing in respective circuits, we prove that the n-qubit analogue of the TOFFOLI requires at least 2n CNOT gates. Additionally, our results offer a complete classification of three-qubit diagonal operators by their CNOT-cost, which holds even if ancilla qubits are available.',\n",

We present a systematic, algebraically based, design methodology for efficient implementation of computer programs optimized over multiple levels of the processor/memory and network hierarchy. Using a common formalism to describe the problem and the partitioning of data over processors and memory levels allows one to mathematically prove the efficiency and correctness of a given algorithm as measured in terms of a set of metrics (such as processor/network speeds, etc.). The approach allows the average programmer to achieve high-level optimizations similar to those used by compiler writers (e.g. the notion of \"tiling\").   The approach presented in this monograph makes use of A Mathematics of Arrays (MoA, Mullin 1988) and an indexing calculus (i.e. the psi-calculus) to enable the programmer to develop algorithms using high-level compiler-like optimizations through the ability to algebraically compose and reduce sequences of array operations.

This paper describes a new iterative recovery algorithm called CoSaMP that delivers the same guarantees as the best optimization-based approaches. Moreover, this algorithm offers rigorous bounds on computational cost and storage. It is likely to be extremely efficient for practical problems because it requires only matrix-vector multiplies with the sampling matrix. For many cases of interest, the running time is just O(N*log^2(N)), where N is the length of the signal.',\n",

We present a general rate duality between the multiple access channel (MAC) and the broadcast channel (BC) which is applicable to systems with and without nonlinear interference cancellation. Different to the state-of-the-art rate duality with interference subtraction from Vishwanath et al., the proposed duality is filter-based instead of covariance-based and exploits the arising unitary degree of freedom to decorrelate every point-to-point link. Therefore, it allows for noncooperative stream-wise decoding which reduces complexity and latency. Moreover, the conversion from one domain to the other does not exhibit any dependencies during its computation making it accessible to a parallel implementation instead of a serial one. We additionally derive a rate duality for systems with multi-antenna terminals when linear filtering without interference (pre-)subtraction is applied and the different streams of a single user are not treated as self-interference. Both dualities are based on a framework already applied to a mean-square-error duality between the MAC and the BC. Thanks to this novel rate duality, any rate-based optimization with linear filtering in the BC can now be handled in the dual MAC where the arising expressions lead to more efficient algorithmic solutions than in the BC due to the alignment of the channel and precoder indices.',\n",

We construct explicit rate-one, full-diversity, geometrically dense matrix lattices with large, non-vanishing determinants (NVD) for four transmit antenna multiple-input single-output (MISO) space-time (ST) applications. The constructions are based on the theory of rings of algebraic integers and related subrings of the Hamiltonian quaternions and can be extended to a larger number of Tx antennas. The usage of ideals guarantees a non-vanishing determinant larger than one and an easy way to present the exact proofs for the minimum determinants. The idea of finding denser sublattices within a given division algebra is then generalized to a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) case with an arbitrary number of Tx antennas by using the theory of cyclic division algebras (CDA) and maximal orders. It is also shown that the explicit constructions in this paper all have a simple decoding method based on sphere decoding. Related to the decoding complexity, the notion of sensitivity is introduced, and experimental evidence indicating a connection between sensitivity, decoding complexity and performance is provided. Simulations in a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel show that our dense quaternionic constructions outperform both the earlier rectangular lattices and the rotated ABBA lattice as well as the DAST lattice. We also show that our quaternionic lattice is better than the DAST lattice in terms of the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff.',\n",

Once that collocations are discovered, they become managed in separated memory blocks broken down by the actors. As for human beings, the memory blocks refer to associative mind-maps.

Each two nodes are assumed to be either connected through a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel, or disconnected.

Furthermore, we derive diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the proposed RS scheme for general single-antenna multiple-relay networks. It is shown that for single-antenna two-hop multiple-access multiple-relay ($K>1$) networks (without direct link between the transmitter(s) and the receiver), the proposed RS scheme achieves the optimum DMT. However, for the case of multiple access single relay setup, we show that the RS scheme reduces to the naive amplify-and-forward relaying and is not optimum in terms of DMT, while the dynamic decode-and-forward scheme is shown to be optimum for this scenario.',\n",

We demonstrate that even a relatively small number of shortcuts unite the networks into one.

It is shown that by learning the value-gradients exploration or stochastic behaviour is no longer needed to find locally optimal trajectories. This is the main motivation for using value-gradients, and it is argued that learning value-gradients is the actual objective of any value-function learning algorithm for control problems. It is also argued that learning value-gradients is significantly more efficient than learning just the values, and this argument is supported in experiments by efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude, in several problem domains. Once value-gradients are introduced into learning, several analyses become possible. For example, a surprising equivalence between a value-gradient learning algorithm and a policy-gradient learning algorithm is proven, and this provides a robust convergence proof for control problems using a value function with a general function approximator.',\n",

Desharnais, Gupta, Jagadeesan and Panangaden introduced a family of behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic transition systems.

Each pseudometric has a discount factor, a real number in the interval (0, 1]. The smaller the discount factor, the more the future is discounted. If the discount factor is one, then the future is not discounted at all. Desharnais et al. showed that the behavioural distances can be calculated up to any desired degree of accuracy if the discount factor is smaller than one. In this paper, we show that the distances can also be approximated if the future is not discounted. A key ingredient of our algorithm is Tarski's decision procedure for the first order theory over real closed fields.

This paper considers state estimation of linear systems using analog amplify and forwarding with multiple sensors, for both multiple access and orthogonal access schemes. Optimal state estimation can be achieved at the fusion center using a time varying Kalman filter. We show that in many situations, the estimation error covariance decays at a rate of $1/M$ when the number of sensors $M$ is large. We consider optimal allocation of transmission powers that 1) minimizes the sum power usage subject to an error covariance constraint and 2) minimizes the error covariance subject to a sum power constraint. In the case of fading channels with channel state information the optimization problems are solved using a greedy approach, while for fading channels without channel state information but with channel statistics available a sub-optimal linear estimator is derived.',\n",

For example, the constraints might specify that some measurement operators must commute.   We show that if an instance of the quantum moment problem is unsatisfiable, then there exists a certificate of a particular form proving this. Our proof is based on a recent result in algebraic geometry, the noncommutative Positivstellensatz of Helton and McCullough [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 356(9):3721, 2004].   A special case of the quantum moment problem is to compute the value of one-round multi-prover games with entangled provers.

In compressed sensing we are interested in finding the sparsest solution to the system of equations A x = y for a given y. In general, whenever the sparsity of x is smaller than half the dimension of y then with overwhelming probability over A the sparsest solution is unique and can be found by an exhaustive search over x with an exponential time complexity for any y. The recent work of Cand\\\\'es, Donoho, and Tao shows that minimization of the L_1 norm of x subject to A x = y results in the sparsest solution provided the sparsity of x, say K, is smaller than a certain threshold for a given number of measurements. Specifically, if the dimension of y approaches the dimension of x, the sparsity of x should be K < 0.239 N. Here, we consider the case where x is d-block sparse, i.e., x consists of n = N / d blocks where each block is either a zero vector or a nonzero vector. Instead of L_1-norm relaxation, we consider the following relaxation min x \\\\| X_1 \\\\|_2 + \\\\| X_2 \\\\|_2 + ... + \\\\| X_n \\\\|_2, subject to A x = y where X_i = (x_{(i-1)d+1}, x_{(i-1)d+2}, ..., x_{i d}) for i = 1,2, ..., N. Our main result is that as n -> \\\\infty, the minimization finds the sparsest solution to Ax = y, with overwhelming probability in A, for any x whose block sparsity is k/n < 1/2 - O(\\\\epsilon), provided M/N > 1 - 1/d, and d = \\\\Omega(\\\\log(1/\\\\epsilon)/\\\\epsilon). The relaxation can be solved in polynomial time using semi-definite programming.\",\n",
              " 'Outage Probability of the Gaussian MIMO Free-Space Optical Channel with   PPM.  The free-space optical channel has the potential to facilitate inexpensive, wireless communication with fiber-like bandwidth under short deployment timelines. However, atmospheric effects can significantly degrade the reliability of a free-space optical link. In particular, atmospheric turbulence causes random fluctuations in the irradiance of the received laser beam, commonly referred to as scintillation. The scintillation process is slow compared to the large data rates typical of optical transmission. As such, we adopt a quasi-static block fading model and study the outage probability of the channel under the assumption of orthogonal pulse-position modulation. We investigate the mitigation of scintillation through the use of multiple lasers and multiple apertures, thereby creating a multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) channel. Non-ideal photodetection is also assumed such that the combined shot noise and thermal noise are considered as signal-independent Additive Gaussian white noise. Assuming perfect receiver channel state information (CSI), we compute the signal-to-noise ratio exponents for the cases when the scintillation is lognormal, exponential and gamma-gamma distributed, which cover a wide range of atmospheric turbulence conditions. Furthermore, we illustrate very large gains, in some cases larger than 15 dB, when transmitter CSI is also available by adapting the transmitted electrical power.',\n",

A computational model of the construction of word meaning through exposure to texts is built in order to simulate the effects of co-occurrence values on word semantic similarities, paragraph by paragraph. Semantic similarity is here viewed as association. It turns out that the similarity between two words W1 and W2 strongly increases with a co-occurrence, decreases with the occurrence of W1 without W2 or W2 without W1, and slightly increases with high-order co-occurrences. Therefore, operationalizing similarity as a frequency of co-occurrence probably introduces a bias: first, there are cases in which there is similarity without co-occurrence and, second, the frequency of co-occurrence overestimates similarity.',\n",
              " 'A proof theoretic analysis of intruder theories.  We consider the problem of intruder deduction in security protocol analysis: that is, deciding whether a given message $M$ can be deduced from a set of messages $\\\\Gamma$ under the theory of blind signatures and arbitrary convergent equational theories modulo associativity and commutativity (AC) of certain binary operators. The traditional formulations of intruder deduction are usually given in natural-deduction-like systems and proving decidability requires significant effort in showing that the rules are \"local\" in some sense. By using the well-known translation between natural deduction and sequent calculus, we recast the intruder deduction problem as proof search in sequent calculus, in which locality is immediate. Using standard proof theoretic methods, such as permutability of rules and cut elimination, we show that the intruder deduction problem can be reduced, in polynomial time, to the elementary deduction problems, which amounts to solving certain equations in the underlying individual equational theories. We further show that this result extends to combinations of disjoint AC-convergent theories whereby the decidability of intruder deduction under the combined theory reduces to the decidability of elementary deduction in each constituent theory. Although various researchers have reported similar results for individual cases, our work shows that these results can be obtained using a systematic and uniform methodology based on the sequent calculus.',\n",

There exists an injective, information-preserving function that maps a semantic network (i.e a directed labeled network) to a directed network (i.e. a directed unlabeled network). The edge label in the semantic network is represented as a topological feature of the directed network. Also, there exists an injective function that maps a directed network to an undirected network (i.e. an undirected unlabeled network). The edge directionality in the directed network is represented as a topological feature of the undirected network. Through function composition, there exists an injective function that maps a semantic network to an undirected network. Thus, aside from space constraints, the semantic network construct does not have any modeling functionality that is not possible with either a directed or undirected network representation. Two proofs of this idea will be presented. The first is a proof of the aforementioned function composition concept.

This question is equivalent to the question ''How important is the orientation of the axis of discretization for the result of the simulation?'' An optimization in terms of symmetry can be combined with the implementation of higher and heterogeniously distributed walking speeds by representing different walking speeds via different amounts of cells an agent may move during one round. Therefore all different possible neighborhoods for speeds up to v = 10 (cells per round) will be examined for the amount of deviation from radial symmetry. Simple criteria will be stated which will allow find an optimal neighborhood for each speed. It will be shown that following these criteria even the best mixture of steps in Moore and von Neumann neighborhoods is unable to reproduce the optimal neighborhood for a speed as low as 4.\",\n",

The sum-capacity is studied for a K-user degraded Gaussian multiaccess relay channel (MARC) where the multiaccess signal received at the destination from the K sources and relay is a degraded version of the signal received at the relay from all sources, given the transmit signal at the relay. An outer bound on the capacity region is developed using cutset bounds. An achievable rate region is obtained for the decode-and-forward (DF) strategy. It is shown that for every choice of input distribution, the rate regions for the inner (DF) and outer bounds are given by the intersection of two K-dimensional polymatroids, one resulting from the multiaccess link at the relay and the other from that at the destination. Although the inner and outer bound rate regions are not identical in general, for both cases, a classical result on the intersection of two polymatroids is used to show that the intersection belongs to either the set of active cases or inactive cases, where the two bounds on the K-user sum-rate are active or inactive, respectively. It is shown that DF achieves the capacity region for a class of degraded Gaussian MARCs in which the relay has a high SNR link to the destination relative to the multiaccess link from the sources to the relay. Otherwise, DF is shown to achieve the sum-capacity for an active class of degraded Gaussian MARCs for which the DF sum-rate is maximized by a polymatroid intersection belonging to the set of active cases. This class is shown to include the class of symmetric Gaussian MARCs where all users transmit at the same power.',\n",
              " \"Joint Beamforming for Multiaccess MIMO Systems with Finite Rate Feedback.  This paper considers multiaccess multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with finite rate feedback. The goal is to understand how to efficiently employ the given finite feedback resource to maximize the sum rate by characterizing the performance analytically. Towards this, we propose a joint quantization and feedback strategy: the base station selects the strongest users, jointly quantizes their strongest eigen-channel vectors and broadcasts a common feedback to all the users. This joint strategy is different from an individual strategy, in which quantization and feedback are performed across users independently, and it improves upon the individual strategy in the same way that vector quantization improves upon scalar quantization. In our proposed strategy, the effect of user selection is analyzed by extreme order statistics, while the effect of joint quantization is quantified by what we term ``the composite Grassmann manifold''. The achievable sum rate is then estimated by random matrix theory. Due to its simple implementation and solid performance analysis, the proposed scheme provides a benchmark for multiaccess MIMO systems with finite rate feedback.\",\n",

This work focuses on the more relevant frequency selective case, where some important new aspects emerge. We consider a MIMO-OFDM broadcast channel and compare achievable ergodic rates under three channel state feedback schemes: analog feedback, direction quantized feedback and \"time-domain\" channel quantized feedback. The first two schemes are direct extensions of previously proposed schemes. The third scheme is novel, and it is directly inspired by rate-distortion theory of Gaussian correlated sources. For each scheme we derive the conditions under which the system achieves full multiplexing gain. The key difference with respect to the widely treated frequency-flat case is that in MIMO-OFDM the frequency-domain channel transfer function is a Gaussian correlated source. The new time-domain quantization scheme takes advantage of the channel frequency correlation structure and outperforms the other schemes. Furthermore, it is by far simpler to implement than complicated spherical vector quantization. In particular, we observe that no structured codebook design and vector quantization is actually needed for efficient channel state information feedback.',\n",

They also introduced the \\\\emph{Colored Burau Key Agreement Protocol (CBKAP)}, a concrete realization of this scheme.   We present general, efficient heuristic algorithms, which extract the shared key out of the public information provided by CBKAP. These algorithms are, according to heuristic reasoning and according to massive experiments, successful for all sizes of the security parameters, assuming that the keys are chosen with standard distributions.   Our methods come from probabilistic group theory (permutation group actions and expander graphs). In particular, we provide a simple algorithm for finding short expressions of permutations in $S_n$, as products of given random permutations. Heuristically, our algorithm gives expressions of length $O(n^2\\\\log n)$, in time and space $O(n^3)$.

The topic of this study is the outage behavior of multiple-antenna slow fading channels with quantized feedback and partial power control. A fixed-rate communication system is considered. It is known from the literature that with error-free feedback, the outage-optimal quantizer for power control has a circular structure. Moreover, the diversity gain of the system increases polynomially with the cardinality of the power control codebook. Here, a similar system is studied, but when the feedback link is error-prone. We prove that in the high-SNR regime, the optimal quantizer structure with noisy feedback is still circular and the optimal Voronoi regions are contiguous non-zero probability intervals. Furthermore, the optimal power control codebook resembles a channel optimized scalar quantizer (COSQ), i.e., the Voronoi regions merge with erroneous feedback information. Using a COSQ, the outage performance of the system is superior to that of a no-feedback scheme. However, asymptotic analysis shows that the diversity gain of the system is the same as a no-CSIT scheme if there is a non-zero and non-vanishing feedback error probability.',\n",

This paper focuses on spatial interference cancelation with perfect channel state information (CSI), and analyzes the corresponding network capacity. Specifically, by using multiple antennas, zero-forcing beamforming is applied at each receiver for canceling the strongest interferers. Given spatial interference cancelation, the network transmission capacity is analyzed in this paper, which is defined as the maximum transmitting node density under constraints on outage and the signal-to-interference-noise ratio. Assuming the Poisson distribution for the locations of network nodes and spatially i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels, mathematical tools from stochastic geometry are applied for deriving scaling laws for transmission capacity. Specifically, for small target outage probability, transmission capacity is proved to increase following a power law, where the exponent is the inverse of the size of antenna array or larger depending on the pass loss exponent. As shown by simulations, spatial interference cancelation increases transmission capacity by an order of magnitude or more even if only one extra antenna is added to each node.',\n",

When the PDEs are nonlinear, the speed of propagation of the phenomena, called the wavespeed, at any point in the spacetime domain is computed as part of the solution. We give an advancing front algorithm to construct a simplicial mesh of the spacetime domain suitable for DG solutions. Given a simplicial mesh of a bounded linear or planar space domain M, we incrementally construct a mesh of the spacetime domain M x [0,infinity) such that the solution can be computed in constant time per element. We add a patch of spacetime elements to the mesh at every step. The boundary of every patch is causal which means that the elements in the patch can be solved immediately and that the patches in the mesh are partially ordered by dependence. The elements in a single patch are coupled because they share implicit faces; however, the number of elements in each patch is bounded. The main contribution of this paper is sufficient constraints on the progress in time made by the algorithm at each step which guarantee that a new patch with causal boundary can be added to the mesh at every step even when the wavespeed is increasing discontinuously. Our algorithm adapts to the local gradation of the space mesh as well as the wavespeed that most constrains progress at each step. Previous algorithms have been restricted at each step by the maximum wavespeed throughout the entire spacetime domain.',\n",

We consider large MIMO systems, where by `{\\\\em large}' we mean number of transmit and receive antennas of the order of tens to hundreds. Such large MIMO systems will be of immense interest because of the very high spectral efficiencies possible in such systems. We present a low-complexity detector which achieves uncoded near-exponential diversity performance for hundreds of antennas (i.e., achieves near SISO AWGN performance in a large MIMO fading environment) with an average per-bit complexity of just $O(N_tN_r)$, where $N_t$ and $N_r$ denote the number of transmit and receive antennas, respectively. With an outer turbo code, the proposed detector achieves good coded bit error performance as well. For example, in a 600 transmit and 600 receive antennas V-BLAST system with a high spectral efficiency of 200 bps/Hz (using BPSK and rate-1/3 turbo code), our simulation results show that the proposed detector performs close to within about 4.6 dB from theoretical capacity. We also adopt the proposed detector for the low-complexity decoding of high-rate non-orthogonal space-time block codes (STBC) from division algebras (DA). For example, we have decoded the $16\\\\times 16$ full-rate non-orthogonal STBC from DA using the proposed detector and show that it performs close to within about 5.5 dB of the capacity using 4-QAM and rate-3/4 turbo code at a spectral efficiency of 24 bps/Hz. The practical feasibility of the proposed high-performance low-complexity detector could potentially trigger wide interest in the implementation of large MIMO systems. In large MC-CDMA systems with hundreds of users, the proposed detector is shown to achieve near single-user performance at an average per-bit complexity linear in number of users, which is quite appealing for its use in practical CDMA systems.\",\n",

              " \"Network Beamforming Using Relays with Perfect Channel Information.  This paper is on beamforming in wireless relay networks with perfect channel information at relays, the receiver, and the transmitter if there is a direct link between the transmitter and receiver. It is assumed that every node in the network has its own power constraint. A two-step amplify-and-forward protocol is used, in which the transmitter and relays not only use match filters to form a beam at the receiver but also adaptively adjust their transmit powers according to the channel strength information. For a network with any number of relays and no direct link, the optimal power control is solved analytically. The complexity of finding the exact solution is linear in the number of relays. Our results show that the transmitter should always use its maximal power and the optimal power used at a relay is not a binary function. It can take any value between zero and its maximum transmit power. Also, this value depends on the quality of all other channels in addition to the relay's own channels. Despite this coupling fact, distributive strategies are proposed in which, with the aid of a low-rate broadcast from the receiver, a relay needs only its own channel information to implement the optimal power control. Simulated performance shows that network beamforming achieves the maximal diversity and outperforms other existing schemes. Then, beamforming in networks with a direct link are considered. We show that when the direct link exists during the first step only, the optimal power control is the same as that of networks with no direct link. For networks with a direct link during the second step, recursive numerical algorithms are proposed to solve the power control problem. Simulation shows that by adjusting the transmitter and relays' powers adaptively, network performance is significantly improved.\",\n",

Modern communication receiver architectures center around digital signal processing (DSP), with the bulk of the receiver processing being performed on digital signals obtained after analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). In this paper, we explore Shannon-theoretic performance limits when ADC precision is drastically reduced, from typical values of 8-12 bits used in current communication transceivers, to 1-3 bits. The goal is to obtain insight on whether DSP-centric transceiver architectures are feasible as communication bandwidths scale up, recognizing that high-precision ADC at high sampling rates is either unavailable, or too costly or power-hungry. Specifically, we evaluate the communication limits imposed by low-precision ADC for the ideal real discrete-time Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, under an average power constraint on the input. For an ADC with K quantization bins (i.e., a precision of log2 K bits), we show that the Shannon capacity is achievable by a discrete input distribution with at most K + 1 mass points. For 2-bin (1-bit) symmetric ADC, this result is tightened to show that binary antipodal signaling is optimum for any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For multi-bit ADC, the capacity is computed numerically, and the results obtained are used to make the following encouraging observations regarding system design with low-precision ADC : (a) even at moderately high SNR of up to 20 dB, 2-3 bit quantization results in only 10-20% reduction of spectral efficiency, which is acceptable for large communication bandwidths, (b) standard equiprobable pulse amplitude modulation with ADC thresholds set to implement maximum likelihood hard decisions is asymptotically optimum at high SNR, and works well at low to moderate SNRs as well.',\n",

For a specific rate decay, we show that the Lasso selects all the variables that should enter the model with probability tending to one exponentially fast, while it selects all other variables with strictly positive probability. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso for several bootstrapped replications of a given sample, then intersecting the supports of the Lasso bootstrap estimates leads to consistent model selection.

A wiretap channel with a helping interferer (WT-HI), in which a transmitter sends a confidential message to its intended receiver in the presence of a passive eavesdropper, and with the help of an independent interferer, is considered. The interferer, which does not know the confidential message, helps in ensuring the secrecy of the message by sending independent signals. An achievable secrecy rate for the WT-HI is given. The results show that interference can be exploited to assist secrecy in wireless communications. An important example of the Gaussian case, in which the interferer has a better channel to the intended receiver than to the eavesdropper, is considered. In this situation, the interferer can send a (random) codeword at a rate that ensures that it can be decoded and subtracted from the received signal by the intended receiver but cannot be decoded by the eavesdropper. Hence, only the eavesdropper is interfered with and the secrecy level of the confidential message is increased.',\n",

              " 'On Kernelization of Supervised Mahalanobis Distance Learners.  This paper focuses on the problem of kernelizing an existing supervised Mahalanobis distance learner. The following features are included in the paper. Firstly, three popular learners, namely, \"neighborhood component analysis\", \"large margin nearest neighbors\" and \"discriminant neighborhood embedding\", which do not have kernel versions are kernelized in order to improve their classification performances. Secondly, an alternative kernelization framework called \"KPCA trick\" is presented. Implementing a learner in the new framework gains several advantages over the standard framework, e.g. no mathematical formulas and no reprogramming are required for a kernel implementation, the framework avoids troublesome problems such as singularity, etc. Thirdly, while the truths of representer theorems are just assumptions in previous papers related to ours, here, representer theorems are formally proven. The proofs validate both the kernel trick and the KPCA trick in the context of Mahalanobis distance learning. Fourthly, unlike previous works which always apply brute force methods to select a kernel, we investigate two approaches which can be efficiently adopted to construct an appropriate kernel for a given dataset. Finally, numerical results on various real-world datasets are presented.',\n",

This paper is concerned with spectrum sharing cognitive radio networks, where a secondary user (SU) or cognitive radio link communicates simultaneously over the same frequency band with an existing primary user (PU) link. It is assumed that the SU transmitter has the perfect channel state information (CSI) on the fading channels from SU transmitter to both PU and SU receivers (as usually assumed in the literature), as well as the fading channel from PU transmitter to PU receiver (a new assumption). With the additional PU CSI, we study the optimal power control for the SU over different fading states to maximize the SU ergodic capacity subject to a new proposed constraint to protect the PU transmission, which limits the maximum ergodic capacity loss of the PU resulted from the SU transmission. It is shown that the proposed SU power-control policy is superior over the conventional policy under the constraint on the maximum tolerable interference power/interperferecne temperature at the PU receiver, in terms of the achievable ergodic capacities of both PU and SU.',\n",

We derive two lower bounds on the rate distortion function which are valid for any low-density generator-matrix code with a given node degree distribution L(x) on the set of generators and for any encoding algorithm. These bounds show that, due to the sparseness of the code, the performance is strictly bounded away from the Shannon rate-distortion function. In this sense, our bounds represent a natural generalization of Gallager's bound on the maximum rate at which low-density parity-check codes can be used for reliable transmission.

              " 'Information Acquisition and Exploitation in Multichannel Wireless   Networks.  A wireless system with multiple channels is considered, where each channel has several transmission states. A user learns about the instantaneous state of an available channel by transmitting a control packet in it. Since probing all channels consumes significant energy and time, a user needs to determine what and how much information it needs to acquire about the instantaneous states of the available channels so that it can maximize its transmission rate. This motivates the study of the trade-off between the cost of information acquisition and its value towards improving the transmission rate.   A simple model is presented for studying this information acquisition and exploitation trade-off when the channels are multi-state, with different distributions and information acquisition costs. The objective is to maximize a utility function which depends on both the cost and value of information. Solution techniques are presented for computing near-optimal policies with succinct representation in polynomial time. These policies provably achieve at least a fixed constant factor of the optimal utility on any problem instance, and in addition, have natural characterizations. The techniques are based on exploiting the structure of the optimal policy, and use of Lagrangean relaxations which simplify the space of approximately optimal solutions.',\n",

One considers here orderable acyclic digraphs named KoDAGs which represent the outmost general chains of dibicliques denoting thus the outmost general chains of binary relations. Because of this fact KoDAGs start to become an outstanding concept of nowadays investigation. We propose here examples of codings of KoDAGs looked upon as infinite hyper-boxes as well as chains of rectangular hyper-boxes in N^\\\\infty. Neither of KoDAGs codings considered here is a poset isomorphism with Pi = <P, \\\\leq>. Nevertheless every example of coding supplies a new view on possible investigation of KoDAGs properties.

We derive bounds on the noncoherent capacity of wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channels that are selective both in time and frequency, and are underspread, i.e., the product of the channel's delay spread and Doppler spread is small. For input signals that are peak constrained in time and frequency, we obtain upper and lower bounds on capacity that are explicit in the channel's scattering function, are accurate for a large range of bandwidth and allow to coarsely identify the capacity-optimal bandwidth as a function of the peak power and the channel's scattering function. We also obtain a closed-form expression for the first-order Taylor series expansion of capacity in the limit of large bandwidth, and show that our bounds are tight in the wideband regime. For input signals that are peak constrained in time only (and, hence, allowed to be peaky in frequency), we provide upper and lower bounds on the infinite-bandwidth capacity and find cases when the bounds coincide and the infinite-bandwidth capacity is characterized exactly. Our lower bound is closely related to a result by Viterbi (1967).   The analysis in this paper is based on a discrete-time discrete-frequency approximation of WSSUS time- and frequency-selective channels. This discretization explicitly takes into account the underspread property, which is satisfied by virtually all wireless communication channels.\",\n",

First, we focus on ST code constructions for the short block-length case, i.e., when the block-length is equal to or slightly larger than the number of transmit antennas. We present constructions based on dense lattice packings and nested lattice (Voronoi) shaping. Our codes achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of quasi-static MIMO fading channels for any fading statistics, and perform very well also at practical, moderate values of signal to noise ratios (SNR). Then, we extend the construction to the case of large block lengths, by using trellis coset coding. We provide constructions of trellis coded modulation (TCM) schemes that are endowed with good packing and shaping properties. Both short-block and trellis constructions allow for a reduced complexity decoding algorithm based on minimum mean squared error generalized decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-GDFE) lattice decoding and a combination of this with a Viterbi TCM decoder for the TCM case. Beyond the interesting algebraic structure, we exhibit codes whose performance is among the state-of-the art considering codes with similar encoding/decoding complexity.',\n",

The problem of detecting the sparsity pattern of a k-sparse vector in R^n from m random noisy measurements is of interest in many areas such as system identification, denoising, pattern recognition, and compressed sensing. This paper addresses the scaling of the number of measurements m, with signal dimension n and sparsity-level nonzeros k, for asymptotically-reliable detection. We show a necessary condition for perfect recovery at any given SNR for all algorithms, regardless of complexity, is m = Omega(k log(n-k)) measurements. Conversely, it is shown that this scaling of Omega(k log(n-k)) measurements is sufficient for a remarkably simple ``maximum correlation'' estimator. Hence this scaling is optimal and does not require more sophisticated techniques such as lasso or matching pursuit. The constants for both the necessary and sufficient conditions are precisely defined in terms of the minimum-to-average ratio of the nonzero components and the SNR. The necessary condition improves upon previous results for maximum likelihood estimation. For lasso, it also provides a necessary condition at any SNR and for low SNR improves upon previous work. The sufficient condition provides the first asymptotically-reliable detection guarantee at finite SNR.\",\n",

Partition functions, also known as homomorphism functions, form a rich family of graph invariants that contain combinatorial invariants such as the number of k-colourings or the number of independent sets of a graph and also the partition functions of certain \"spin glass\" models of statistical physics such as the Ising model.   Building on earlier work by Dyer, Greenhill and Bulatov, Grohe, we completely classify the computational complexity of partition functions. Our main result is a dichotomy theorem stating that every partition function is either computable in polynomial time or #P-complete. Partition functions are described by symmetric matrices with real entries, and we prove that it is decidable in polynomial time in terms of the matrix whether a given partition function is in polynomial time or #P-complete.   While in general it is very complicated to give an explicit algebraic or combinatorial description of the tractable cases, for partition functions described by a Hadamard matrices -- these turn out to be central in our proofs -- we obtain a simple algebraic tractability criterion, which says that the tractable cases are those \"representable\" by a quadratic polynomial over the field GF(2).',\n",

Direct application of network coding at the physical layer - physical layer network coding (PNC) - is a promising technique for two-way relay wireless networks. In a two-way relay network, relay nodes are used to relay two-way information flows between pairs of end nodes. This paper proposes a precise definition for PNC. Specifically, in PNC, a relay node does not decode the source information from the two ends separately, but rather directly maps the combined signals received simultaneously to a signal to be relayed. Based on this definition, PNC can be further sub-classed into two categories - PNCF (PNC over finite field) and PNCI (PNC over infinite field) - according to whether the network-code field (or groups, rings) adopted is finite or infinite. For each of PNCF and PNCI, we consider two specific estimation techniques for dealing with noise in the mapping process.

Mechanism design is now a standard tool in computer science for aligning the incentives of self-interested agents with the objectives of a system designer. There is, however, a fundamental disconnect between the traditional application domains of mechanism design (such as auctions) and those arising in computer science (such as networks): while monetary transfers (i.e., payments) are essential for most of the known positive results in mechanism design, they are undesirable or even technologically infeasible in many computer systems. Classical impossibility results imply that the reach of mechanisms without transfers is severely limited.   Computer systems typically do have the ability to reduce service quality--routing systems can drop or delay traffic, scheduling protocols can delay the release of jobs, and computational payment schemes can require computational payments from users (e.g., in spam-fighting systems). Service degradation is tantamount to requiring that users burn money}, and such ``payments'' can be used to influence the preferences of the agents at a cost of degrading the social surplus.   We develop a framework for the design and analysis of money-burning mechanisms to maximize the residual surplus--the total value of the chosen outcome minus the payments required.\",\n",

Mobile sensor networks are important for several strategic applications devoted to monitoring critical areas. In such hostile scenarios, sensors cannot be deployed manually and are either sent from a safe location or dropped from an aircraft. Mobile devices permit a dynamic deployment reconfiguration that improves the coverage in terms of completeness and uniformity.   In this paper we propose a distributed algorithm for the autonomous deployment of mobile sensors called Push&Pull. According to our proposal, movement decisions are made by each sensor on the basis of locally available information and do not require any prior knowledge of the operating conditions or any manual tuning of key parameters.   We formally prove that, when a sufficient number of sensors are available, our approach guarantees a complete and uniform coverage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm execution always terminates preventing movement oscillations.   Numerous simulations show that our algorithm reaches a complete coverage within reasonable time with moderate energy consumption, even when the target area has irregular shapes. Performance comparisons between Push&Pull and one of the most acknowledged algorithms show how the former one can efficiently reach a more uniform and complete coverage under a wide range of working scenarios.',\n",

Motivated by its simplicity, this scheme is extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity for any number of relays. The conditions on the distributed space time block code (DSTBC) structure that admit its application in the proposed transmission scheme are identified and it is pointed out that the recently proposed full diversity four group decodable DSTBCs from precoded co-ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs and extended Clifford algebras satisfy these conditions. It is then shown how differential encoding at the source can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme to arrive at a new transmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity in asynchronous wireless relay networks with no channel information and also no timing error knowledge at the destination node. Finally, four group decodable distributed differential space time block codes applicable in this new transmission scheme for power of two number of relays are also provided.',\n",

We give an $O(nd^4(2d+1)^{2d})$ time algorithm that for an unweighted graph metric $M$ and integer $d$ either constructs an embedding of $M$ into the line with distortion at most $d$, or concludes that no such embedding exists. We find the result surprising, because the considered problem bears a strong resemblance to the notoriously hard Bandwidth Minimization problem which does not admit any FPT algorithm unless an unlikely collapse of parameterized complexity classes occurs.   We show that our algorithm can also be applied to construct small distortion embeddings of weighted graph metrics. The running time of our algorithm is $O(n(dW)^4(2d+1)^{2dW})$ where $W$ is the largest edge weight of the input graph. We also show that deciding whether a weighted graph metric $M(G)$ with maximum weight $W < |V(G)|$ can be embedded into the line with distortion at most $d$ is NP-Complete for every fixed rational $d \\\\geq 2$. This rules out any possibility of an algorithm with running time $O((nW)^{h(d)})$ where $h$ is a function of $d$ alone.   We generalize the result on embedding into the line by proving that for any tree $T$ with maximum degree $\\\\Delta$, embedding of $M$ into a shortest path metric of $T$ is FPT, parameterized by $(\\\\Delta,d)$.',\n",
              " 'The Capacity Of Two Way Relay Channel.  This paper investigates the capacity of a wireless two way relay channel in which two end nodes exchange information via a relay node. The capacity is defined in the information-theoretic sense as the maximum information exchange rate between the two end nodes. We give an upper bound of the capacity by applying the cut-set theorem. We prove that this upper bound can be approached in low SNR region using \"separated\" multiple access for uplinks from the end nodes to the relay in which the data from the end nodes are individually decoded at the relay; and network-coding broadcast for downlinks from the relay to the end nodes in which the relay mixes the information from end nodes before forwarding. We further prove that the capacity is approachable in high SNR region using physical-layer network coding (PNC) multiple access for uplinks, and network-coding broadcast for downlinks. From our proof and observations, we conjecture that the upper bound may be achieved with PNC in all SNR regions.',\n",

For point to point multiple input multiple output systems, Dayal-Brehler-Varanasi have proved that training codes achieve the same diversity order as that of the underlying coherent space time block code (STBC) if a simple minimum mean squared error estimate of the channel formed using the training part is employed for coherent detection of the underlying STBC. In this letter, a similar strategy involving a combination of training, channel estimation and detection in conjunction with existing coherent distributed STBCs is proposed for noncoherent communication in AF relay networks. Simulation results show that the proposed simple strategy outperforms distributed differential space-time coding for AF relay networks. Finally, the proposed strategy is extended to asynchronous relay networks using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing.',\n",

              " 'Information Theoretic Operating Regimes of Large Wireless Networks.  In analyzing the point-to-point wireless channel, insights about two qualitatively different operating regimes--bandwidth- and power-limited--have proven indispensable in the design of good communication schemes. In this paper, we propose a new scaling law formulation for wireless networks that allows us to develop a theory that is analogous to the point-to-point case. We identify fundamental operating regimes of wireless networks and derive architectural guidelines for the design of optimal schemes.   Our analysis shows that in a given wireless network with arbitrary size, area, power, bandwidth, etc., there are three parameters of importance: the short-distance SNR, the long-distance SNR, and the power path loss exponent of the environment. Depending on these parameters we identify four qualitatively different regimes. One of these regimes is especially interesting since it is fundamentally a consequence of the heterogeneous nature of links in a network and does not occur in the point-to-point case; the network capacity is {\\\\em both} power and bandwidth limited. This regime has thus far remained hidden due to the limitations of the existing formulation. Existing schemes, either multihop transmission or hierarchical cooperation, fail to achieve capacity in this regime; we propose a new hybrid scheme that achieves capacity.',\n",

              " \"Information theoretic bounds for Compressed Sensing.  In this paper we derive information theoretic performance bounds to sensing and reconstruction of sparse phenomena from noisy projections. We consider two settings: output noise models where the noise enters after the projection and input noise models where the noise enters before the projection. We consider two types of distortion for reconstruction: support errors and mean-squared errors. Our goal is to relate the number of measurements, $m$, and $\\\\snr$, to signal sparsity, $k$, distortion level, $d$, and signal dimension, $n$. We consider support errors in a worst-case setting. We employ different variations of Fano's inequality to derive necessary conditions on the number of measurements and $\\\\snr$ required for exact reconstruction. To derive sufficient conditions we develop new insights on max-likelihood analysis based on a novel superposition property. In particular this property implies that small support errors are the dominant error events. Consequently, our ML analysis does not suffer the conservatism of the union bound and leads to a tighter analysis of max-likelihood. These results provide order-wise tight bounds. For output noise models we show that asymptotically an $\\\\snr$ of $\\\\Theta(\\\\log(n))$ together with $\\\\Theta(k \\\\log(n/k))$ measurements is necessary and sufficient for exact support recovery. Furthermore, if a small fraction of support errors can be tolerated, a constant $\\\\snr$ turns out to be sufficient in the linear sparsity regime. In contrast for input noise models we show that support recovery fails if the number of measurements scales as $o(n\\\\log(n)/SNR)$ implying poor compression performance for such cases. We also consider Bayesian set-up and characterize tradeoffs between mean-squared distortion and the number of measurements using rate-distortion theory.\",\n",

In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio (CR) network in which the unlicensed (secondary) users are allowed to concurrently access the spectrum allocated to the licensed (primary) users provided that their interference to the primary users (PUs) satisfies certain constraints. We study a weighted sum rate maximization problem for the secondary user (SU) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC), in which the SUs have not only the sum power constraint but also interference constraints. We first transform this multi-constraint maximization problem into its equivalent form, which involves a single constraint with multiple auxiliary variables. Fixing these multiple auxiliary variables, we propose a duality result for the equivalent problem. Our duality result can solve the optimization problem for MIMO-BC with multiple linear constraints, and thus can be viewed as an extension of the conventional results, which rely crucially on a single sum power constraint. Furthermore, we develop an efficient sub-gradient based iterative algorithm to solve the equivalent problem and show that the developed algorithm converges to a globally optimal solution. Simulation results are further provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.',\n",

Although information content is invariant up to an additive constant, the range of possible additive constants applicable to programming languages is so large that in practice it plays a major role in the actual evaluation of K(s), the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity of a string s. Some attempts have been made to arrive at a framework stable enough for a concrete definition of K, independent of any constant under a programming language, by appealing to the \"naturalness\" of the language in question.

The key property of the algorithm is that it is affine-invariant, i.e., it produces the same partition for any affine transformation of the input. It has strong guarantees when the input is drawn from a mixture model. For a mixture of two arbitrary Gaussians, the algorithm correctly classifies the sample assuming only that the two components are separable by a hyperplane, i.e., there exists a halfspace that contains most of one Gaussian and almost none of the other in probability mass. This is nearly the best possible, improving known results substantially. For k > 2 components, the algorithm requires only that there be some (k-1)-dimensional subspace in which the emoverlap in every direction is small. Here we define overlap to be the ratio of the following two quantities: 1) the average squared distance between a point and the mean of its component, and 2) the average squared distance between a point and the mean of the mixture. The main result may also be stated in the language of linear discriminant analysis: if the standard Fisher discriminant is small enough, labels are not needed to estimate the optimal subspace for projection. Our main tools are isotropic transformation, spectral projection and a simple reweighting technique. We call this combination isotropic PCA.',\n",

Furthermore, we present a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for solving the matching interdiction problem on graphs with bounded treewidth. The proposed algorithm extends the approach that is typically used for the creation of efficient algorithms on graphs with bounded treewidth to interdiction problems.',\n",

Inferring the causal structure that links n observables is usually based upon detecting statistical dependences and choosing simple graphs that make the joint measure Markovian. Here we argue why causal inference is also possible when only single observations are present.   We develop a theory how to generate causal graphs explaining similarities between single objects. To this end, we replace the notion of conditional stochastic independence in the causal Markov condition with the vanishing of conditional algorithmic mutual information and describe the corresponding causal inference rules.   We explain why a consistent reformulation of causal inference in terms of algorithmic complexity implies a new inference principle that takes into account also the complexity of conditional probability densities, making it possible to select among Markov equivalent causal graphs. This insight provides a theoretical foundation of a heuristic principle proposed in earlier work.   We also discuss how to replace Kolmogorov complexity with decidable complexity criteria. This can be seen as an algorithmic analog of replacing the empirically undecidable question of statistical independence with practical independence tests that are based on implicit or explicit assumptions on the underlying distribution.',\n",

The distance from a given position toward one or more destinations, exits, and way points is a more or less important input variable in most models of pedestrian dynamics. Except for the special case when there are no obstacles in a concave scenario -- i.e. each position is visible from any other -- the calculation of these distances is a non-trivial task. This isn't that big a problem, as long as the model only demands the distances to be stored in a Static Floor Field also called Potential Field, which never changes throughout the whole simulation. In this case a pre-calculation once before the simulation starts is sufficient. But if one wants to allow changes of the geometry during a simulation run -- imagine doors or the blocking of a corridor due to some hazard -- in the Distance Potential Field, calculation time matters strongly. This contribution gives an overview over existing and new exact and approximate methods to calculate a potential field, analytical investigations for their exactness, and tests of their computation speed. The advantages and drawbacks of the methods are discussed.\",\n",

The approach to reasoning about structural operational semantics style specifications supported by the Abella system is discussed. This approach uses lambda tree syntax to treat object language binding and encodes binding related properties in generic judgments. Further, object language specifications are embedded directly into the reasoning framework through recursive definitions. The treatment of binding via generic judgments implicitly enforces distinctness and atomicity in the names used for bound variables. These properties must, however, be made explicit in reasoning tasks. This objective can be achieved by allowing recursive definitions to also specify generic properties of atomic predicates. The utility of these various logical features in the Abella system is demonstrated through actual reasoning tasks. Brief comparisons with a few other logic based approaches are also made.',\n",

Tracers provide users with useful information about program executions. In this article, we propose a ``tracer driver''. From a single tracer, it provides a powerful front-end enabling multiple dynamic analysis tools to be easily implemented, while limiting the overhead of the trace generation. The relevant execution events are specified by flexible event patterns and a large variety of trace data can be given either systematically or ``on demand''. The proposed tracer driver has been designed in the context of constraint logic programming; experiments have been made within GNU-Prolog. Execution views provided by existing tools have been easily emulated with a negligible overhead. Experimental measures show that the flexibility and power of the described architecture lead to good performance. The tracer driver overhead is inversely proportional to the average time between two traced events. Whereas the principles of the tracer driver are independent of the traced programming language, it is best suited for high-level languages, such as constraint logic programming, where each traced execution event encompasses numerous low-level execution steps. Furthermore, constraint logic programming is especially hard to debug. The current environments do not provide all the useful dynamic analysis tools. They can significantly benefit from our tracer driver which enables dynamic analyses to be integrated at a very low cost.\",\n",

We conclude a sequence of work by giving near-optimal sketching and streaming algorithms for estimating Shannon entropy in the most general streaming model, with arbitrary insertions and deletions. This improves on prior results that obtain suboptimal space bounds in the general model, and near-optimal bounds in the insertion-only model without sketching. Our high-level approach is simple: we give algorithms to estimate Renyi and Tsallis entropy, and use them to extrapolate an estimate of Shannon entropy. The accuracy of our estimates is proven using approximation theory arguments and extremal properties of Chebyshev polynomials, a technique which may be useful for other problems. Our work also yields the best-known and near-optimal additive approximations for entropy, and hence also for conditional entropy and mutual information.',\n",

In wireless data networks, communication is particularly susceptible to eavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. Security and privacy systems have become critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper considers the problem of secret communication over a Gaussian broadcast channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential messages to two users with \\\\emph{information-theoretic secrecy}. That is, each user would like to obtain its own confidential message in a reliable and safe manner. This communication model is referred to as the multi-antenna Gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages (MGBC-CM). Under this communication scenario, a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and the corresponding achievable secrecy rate region are first developed based on Gaussian codebooks. Next, a computable Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy capacity region is provided for the MGBC-CM. Furthermore, the Sato-type outer bound proves to be consistent with the boundary of the secret dirty-paper coding achievable rate region, and hence, the secrecy capacity region of the MGBC-CM is established. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates that both users can achieve positive rates simultaneously under the information-theoretic secrecy requirement.',\n",
              " 'Distance Distributions in Finite Uniformly Random Networks: Theory and   Applications.  In wireless networks, the knowledge of nodal distances is essential for several areas such as system configuration, performance analysis and protocol design. In order to evaluate distance distributions in random networks, the underlying nodal arrangement is almost universally taken to be an infinite Poisson point process. While this assumption is valid in some cases, there are also certain impracticalities to this model. For example, practical networks are non-stationary, and the number of nodes in disjoint areas are not independent. This paper considers a more realistic network model where a finite number of nodes are uniformly randomly distributed in a general d-dimensional ball of radius R and characterizes the distribution of Euclidean distances in the system. The key result is that the probability density function of the distance from the center of the network to its nth nearest neighbor follows a generalized beta distribution. This finding is applied to study network characteristics such as energy consumption, interference, outage and connectivity.',\n",

We consider three capacity definitions for general channels with channel side information at the receiver, where the channel is modeled as a sequence of finite dimensional conditional distributions not necessarily stationary, ergodic, or information stable. The {\\\\em Shannon capacity} is the highest rate asymptotically achievable with arbitrarily small error probability. The {\\\\em capacity versus outage} is the highest rate asymptotically achievable with a given probability of decoder-recognized outage. The {\\\\em expected capacity} is the highest average rate asymptotically achievable with a single encoder and multiple decoders, where the channel side information determines the decoder in use. As a special case of channel codes for expected rate, the code for capacity versus outage has two decoders: one operates in the non-outage states and decodes all transmitted information, and the other operates in the outage states and decodes nothing. Expected capacity equals Shannon capacity for channels governed by a stationary ergodic random process but is typically greater for general channels. These alternative capacity definitions essentially relax the constraint that all transmitted information must be decoded at the receiver. We derive capacity theorems for these capacity definitions through information density. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate their connections and differences. We also discuss the implication of these alternative capacity definitions for end-to-end distortion, source-channel coding and separation.',\n",

Equivalence between pseudocodewords of the linear program and pseudocodewords of graph covers is proved.

These polytope representations lead to polynomial-time decoders for a wide variety of classical nonbinary linear codes. LP decoding performance is illustrated for the [11,6] ternary Golay code with ternary PSK modulation over AWGN, and in this case it is shown that the performance of the LP decoder is comparable to codeword-error-rate-optimum hard-decision based decoding.

We investigate the largest possible value of c_d. It was known that c_d <= 1/(2^d(d+1)!) (this estimate actually holds for every point set S). We construct sets showing that c_d <= (d+1)^{-(d+1)}, and we conjecture this estimate to be tight. The best known lower bound, due to Wagner, is c_d >= gamma_d := (d^2+1)/((d+1)!(d+1)^{d+1}); in his method, p can be chosen as any centerpoint of S. We construct n-point sets with a centerpoint that is contained in no more than gamma_d n^{d+1}+O(n^d) simplices spanned by S, thus showing that the approach using an arbitrary centerpoint cannot be further improved.

We introduce a computable criterion which certifies that a probability distribution between two honest parties and an eavesdropper cannot be (asymptotically) distilled into a secret key. The existence of non-distillable correlations with positive secrecy cost, also known as bound information, is an open question. This criterion may be the key for finding bound information.

In other words, all correlations with positive secrecy cost constitute a useful resource.',\n",

We present a simple model of computation in which states of computations are modelled as data linkages and state changes take place by means of certain actions. We describe the state changes and replies that result from performing those actions by means of a term rewriting system with rule priorities. The model in question is an upgrade of molecular dynamics. The upgrading is mainly concerned with the features to deal with values and the features to reclaim garbage.',\n",
              " 'Rateless Coding for MIMO Block Fading Channels.  In this paper the performance limits and design principles of rateless codes over fading channels are studied. The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is used to analyze the system performance for all possible transmission rates. It is revealed from the analysis that the design of such rateless codes follows the design principle of approximately universal codes for parallel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, in which each sub-channel is a MIMO channel. More specifically, it is shown that for a single-input single-output (SISO) channel, the previously developed permutation codes of unit length for parallel channels having rate LR can be transformed directly into rateless codes of length L having multiple rate levels (R, 2R, . . ., LR), to achieve the DMT performance limit.',\n",
              " 'Combining geometry and combinatorics: A unified approach to sparse   signal recovery.  There are two main algorithmic approaches to sparse signal recovery: geometric and combinatorial. The geometric approach starts with a geometric constraint on the measurement matrix and then uses linear programming to decode information about the signal from its measurements. The combinatorial approach constructs the measurement matrix and a combinatorial decoding algorithm to match. We present a unified approach to these two classes of sparse signal recovery algorithms.   The unifying elements are the adjacency matrices of high-quality unbalanced expanders. We generalize the notion of Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), crucial to compressed sensing results for signal recovery, from the Euclidean norm to the l_p norm for p about 1, and then show that unbalanced expanders are essentially equivalent to RIP-p matrices.   From known deterministic constructions for such matrices, we obtain new deterministic measurement matrix constructions and algorithms for signal recovery which, compared to previous deterministic algorithms, are superior in either the number of measurements or in noise tolerance.',\n",

Moore-Penrose inverse matrices allow for solving such systems, even with rank deficiency, and they provide minimum-norm vectors of synaptic weights, which contribute to the regularization of the input-output mapping. It is thus of interest to develop fast and accurate algorithms for computing Moore-Penrose inverse matrices. In this paper, an algorithm based on a full rank Cholesky factorization is proposed. The resulting pseudoinverse matrices are similar to those provided by other algorithms. However the computation time is substantially shorter, particularly for large systems.',\n",

              " 'The communication complexity of non-signaling distributions.  We study a model of communication complexity that encompasses many well-studied problems, including classical and quantum communication complexity, the complexity of simulating distributions arising from bipartite measurements of shared quantum states, and XOR games. In this model, Alice gets an input x, Bob gets an input y, and their goal is to each produce an output a,b distributed according to some pre-specified joint distribution p(a,b|x,y).   We introduce a new technique based on affine combinations of lower-complexity distributions. Specifically, we introduce two complexity measures, one which gives lower bounds on classical communication, and one for quantum communication. These measures can be expressed as convex optimization problems. We show that the dual formulations have a striking interpretation, since they coincide with maximum violations of Bell and Tsirelson inequalities. The dual expressions are closely related to the winning probability of XOR games. These lower bounds subsume many known communication complexity lower bound methods, most notably the recent lower bounds of Linial and Shraibman for the special case of Boolean functions.   We show that the gap between the quantum and classical lower bounds is at most linear in the size of the support of the distribution, and does not depend on the size of the inputs. This translates into a bound on the gap between maximal Bell and Tsirelson inequality violations, which was previously known only for the case of distributions with Boolean outcomes and uniform marginals.   Finally, we give an exponential upper bound on quantum and classical communication complexity in the simultaneous messages model, for any non-signaling distribution. One consequence is a simple proof that any quantum distribution can be approximated with a constant number of bits of communication.',\n",

              " \"Joint Physical Layer Coding and Network Coding for Bi-Directional   Relaying.  We consider the problem of two transmitters wishing to exchange information through a relay in the middle. The channels between the transmitters and the relay are assumed to be synchronized, average power constrained additive white Gaussian noise channels with a real input with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of snr. An upper bound on the capacity is 1/2 log(1+ snr) bits per transmitter per use of the medium-access phase and broadcast phase of the bi-directional relay channel. We show that using lattice codes and lattice decoding, we can obtain a rate of 1/2 log(0.5 + snr) bits per transmitter, which is essentially optimal at high SNRs. The main idea is to decode the sum of the codewords modulo a lattice at the relay followed by a broadcast phase which performs Slepian-Wolf coding with structured codes. For asymptotically low SNR's, jointly decoding the two transmissions at the relay (MAC channel) is shown to be optimal. We also show that if the two transmitters use identical lattices with minimum angle decoding, we can achieve the same rate of 1/2 log(0.5 + snr). The proposed scheme can be thought of as a joint physical layer, network layer code which outperforms other recently proposed analog network coding schemes.\",\n",

In this paper, we study the effect of feedback channel noise on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in multiuser MIMO systems using quantized feedback, where each user has m transmit antennas and the base-station receiver has n antennas. We derive an achievable tradeoff and use it to show that in SNR-symmetric channels, a single bit of imperfect feedback is sufficient to double the maximum diversity order to 2mn compared to when there is no feedback (maximum is mn at multiplexing gain of zero). Further, additional feedback bits do not increase this maximum diversity order beyond 2mn. Finally, the above diversity order gain of mn over non-feedback systems can also be achieved for higher multiplexing gains, albeit requiring more than one bit of feedback.',\n",

NMF attempts to approximate a matrix with nonnegative entries by a product of two low-rank matrices, also with nonnegative entries. We propose an algorithm called rank-one downdate (R1D) for computing a NMF that is partly motivated by singular value decomposition. This algorithm computes the dominant singular values and vectors of adaptively determined submatrices of a matrix. On each iteration, R1D extracts a rank-one submatrix from the dataset according to an objective function.

We study the properties of Tsallis entropy and Shannon entropy from the point of view of algorithmic randomness. In algorithmic information theory, there are two equivalent ways to define the program-size complexity K(s) of a given finite binary string s. In the standard way, K(s) is defined as the length of the shortest input string for the universal self-delimiting Turing machine to output s. In the other way, the so-called universal probability m is introduced first, and then K(s) is defined as -log_2 m(s) without reference to the concept of program-size. In this paper, we investigate the properties of the Shannon entropy, the power sum, and the Tsallis entropy of a universal probability by means of the notion of program-size complexity. We determine the convergence or divergence of each of these three quantities, and evaluate its degree of randomness if it converges.',\n",

Given a set of quartet topologies over a set of taxa, the Maximum Quartet Consistency (MQC) problem consists of computing a global phylogeny that satisfies the maximum number of quartets. A number of solutions have been proposed for the MQC problem, including Dynamic Programming, Constraint Programming, and more recently Answer Set Programming (ASP). ASP is currently the most efficient approach for optimally solving the MQC problem. This paper proposes encoding the MQC problem with pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. The use of PB allows solving the MQC problem with efficient PB solvers, and also allows considering different modeling approaches for the MQC problem. Initial results are promising, and suggest that PB can be an effective alternative for solving the MQC problem.',\n",

We established in an earlier study that articles listed at or near the top of the daily arXiv:astro-ph mailings receive on average significantly more citations than articles further down the list. In our earlier work we were not able to decide whether this positional citation effect was due to author self-promotion of intrinsically more citable papers or whether papers are cited more often simply because they are at the top of the astro-ph listing. Using new data we can now disentangle both effects. Based on their submission times we separate articles into a self-promoted sample and a sample of articles that achieved a high rank on astro-ph by chance and compare their citation distributions with those of articles on lower astro-ph positions. We find that the positional citation effect is a superposition of self-promotion and visibility bias.',\n",

A data tree is an unranked ordered tree whose every node is labelled by a letter from a finite alphabet and an element (\"datum\") from an infinite set, where the latter can only be compared for equality. The article considers alternating automata on data trees that can move downward and rightward, and have one register for storing data. The main results are that nonemptiness over finite data trees is decidable but not primitive recursive, and that nonemptiness of safety automata is decidable but not elementary. The proofs use nondeterministic tree automata with faulty counters. Allowing upward moves, leftward moves, or two registers, each causes undecidability. As corollaries, decidability is obtained for two data-sensitive fragments of the XPath query language.',\n",

In cellular systems, confidentiality of uplink transmission with respect to eavesdropping terminals can be ensured by creating intentional inteference via scheduling of concurrent downlink transmissions. In this paper, this basic idea is explored from an information-theoretic standpoint by focusing on a two-cell scenario where the involved base stations are connected via a finite-capacity backbone link. A number of transmission strategies are considered that aim at improving uplink confidentiality under constraints on the downlink rate that acts as an interfering signal. The strategies differ mainly in the way the backbone link is exploited by the cooperating downlink- to the uplink-operated base stations. Achievable rates are derived for both the Gaussian (unfaded) and the fading cases, under different assumptions on the channel state information available at different nodes. Numerical results are also provided to corroborate the analysis. Overall, the analysis reveals that a combination of scheduling and base station cooperation is a promising means to improve transmission confidentiality in cellular systems.',\n",

We consider various stochastic models that incorporate the notion of risk-averseness into the standard 2-stage recourse model, and develop novel techniques for solving the algorithmic problems arising in these models. A key notable feature of our work that distinguishes it from work in some other related models, such as the (standard) budget model and the (demand-) robust model, is that we obtain results in the black-box setting, that is, where one is given only sampling access to the underlying distribution. Our first model, which we call the risk-averse budget model, incorporates the notion of risk-averseness via a probabilistic constraint that restricts the probability (according to the underlying distribution) with which the second-stage cost may exceed a given budget B to at most a given input threshold \\\\rho. We also a consider a closely-related model that we call the risk-averse robust model, where we seek to minimize the first-stage cost and the (1-\\\\rho)-quantile of the second-stage cost.   We obtain approximation algorithms for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems including the set cover, vertex cover, multicut on trees, min cut, and facility location problems, in the risk-averse budget and robust models with black-box distributions. We obtain near-optimal solutions that preserve the budget approximately and incur a small blow-up of the probability threshold (both of which are unavoidable). To the best of our knowledge, these are the first approximation results for problems involving probabilistic constraints and black-box distributions. A major component of our results is a fully polynomial approximation scheme for solving the LP-relaxation of the risk-averse problem.',\n",

In a seminal paper from 1985, Sistla and Clarke showed that the model-checking problem for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is either NP-complete or PSPACE-complete, depending on the set of temporal operators used. If, in contrast, the set of propositional operators is restricted, the complexity may decrease. This paper systematically studies the model-checking problem for LTL formulae over restricted sets of propositional and temporal operators. For almost all combinations of temporal and propositional operators, we determine whether the model-checking problem is tractable (in P) or intractable (NP-hard). We then focus on the tractable cases, showing that they all are NL-complete or even logspace solvable. This leads to a surprising gap in complexity between tractable and intractable cases. It is worth noting that our analysis covers an infinite set of problems, since there are infinitely many sets of propositional operators.',\n",
              " 'Decoding Generalized Concatenated Codes Using Interleaved Reed-Solomon   Codes.  Generalized Concatenated codes are a code construction consisting of a number of outer codes whose code symbols are protected by an inner code. As outer codes, we assume the most frequently used Reed-Solomon codes; as inner code, we assume some linear block code which can be decoded up to half its minimum distance. Decoding up to half the minimum distance of Generalized Concatenated codes is classically achieved by the Blokh-Zyablov-Dumer algorithm, which iteratively decodes by first using the inner decoder to get an estimate of the outer code words and then using an outer error/erasure decoder with a varying number of erasures determined by a set of pre-calculated thresholds. In this paper, a modified version of the Blokh-Zyablov-Dumer algorithm is proposed, which exploits the fact that a number of outer Reed-Solomon codes with average minimum distance d can be grouped into one single Interleaved Reed-Solomon code which can be decoded beyond d/2. This allows to skip a number of decoding iterations on the one hand and to reduce the complexity of each decoding iteration significantly - while maintaining the decoding performance - on the other.',\n",

We show that the algorithm has the following properties (made more precise in the main text of the paper)   - It gives near-optimal error guarantees.   - It is robust to observation noise.   - It succeeds with a minimum number of observations.   - It can be used with any sampling operator for which the operator and its adjoint can be computed.   - The memory requirement is linear in the problem size.   - Its computational complexity per iteration is of the same order as the application of the measurement operator or its adjoint.   - It requires a fixed number of iterations depending only on the logarithm of a form of signal to noise ratio of the signal.   - Its performance guarantees are uniform in that they only depend on properties of the sampling operator and signal sparsity.',\n",

This setting differs from the classical MAC in that, prior to each transmission block, the two transmitters can communicate with each other over noise-free bit-pipes of given capacities. The derivation requires a new technique for proving the optimality of Gaussian input distributions in certain mutual information maximizations under a Markov constraint. We also consider a Costa-type extension of the Gaussian MAC with conferencing encoders. In this extension, the channel can be described as a two-user MAC with Gaussian noise and Gaussian interference where the interference is known non-causally to the encoders but not to the decoder. We show that as in Costa's setting the interference sequence can be perfectly canceled, i.e., that the capacity region without interference can be achieved.\",\n",

              " 'Sponsored Search Auctions with Markovian Users.  Sponsored search involves running an auction among advertisers who bid in order to have their ad shown next to search results for specific keywords. Currently, the most popular auction for sponsored search is the \"Generalized Second Price\" (GSP) auction in which advertisers are assigned to slots in the decreasing order of their \"score,\" which is defined as the product of their bid and click-through rate. In the past few years, there has been significant research on the game-theoretic issues that arise in an advertiser\\'s interaction with the mechanism as well as possible redesigns of the mechanism, but this ranking order has remained standard.   From a search engine\\'s perspective, the fundamental question is: what is the best assignment of advertisers to slots? Here \"best\" could mean \"maximizing user satisfaction,\" \"most efficient,\" \"revenue-maximizing,\" \"simplest to interact with,\" or a combination of these. To answer this question we need to understand the behavior of a search engine user when she sees the displayed ads, since that defines the commodity the advertisers are bidding on, and its value. Most prior work has assumed that the probability of a user clicking on an ad is independent of the other ads shown on the page.   We propose a simple Markovian user model that does not make this assumption. We then present an algorithm to determine the most efficient assignment under this model, which turns out to be different than that of GSP. A truthful auction then follows from an application of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. Further, we show that our assignment has many of the desirable properties of GSP that makes bidding intuitive. At the technical core of our result are a number of insights about the structure of the optimal assignment.',\n",

In the constraint programming framework, state-of-the-art static and dynamic decomposition techniques are hard to apply to problems with complete initial constraint graphs. For such problems, we propose a hybrid approach of these techniques in the presence of global constraints. In particular, we solve the subgraph isomorphism problem. Further we design specific heuristics for this hard problem, exploiting its special structure to achieve decomposition. The underlying idea is to precompute a static heuristic on a subset of its constraint network, to follow this static ordering until a first problem decomposition is available, and to switch afterwards to a fully propagated, dynamically decomposing search. Experimental results show that, for sparse graphs, our decomposition method solves more instances than dedicated, state-of-the-art matching algorithms or standard constraint programming approaches.',\n",

We study the convergence time of the best response dynamics in player-specific singleton congestion games. It is well known that this dynamics can cycle, although from every state a short sequence of best responses to a Nash equilibrium exists. Thus, the random best response dynamics, which selects the next player to play a best response uniformly at random, terminates in a Nash equilibrium with probability one. In this paper, we are interested in the expected number of best responses until the random best response dynamics terminates.   As a first step towards this goal, we consider games in which each player can choose between only two resources. These games have a natural representation as (multi-)graphs by identifying nodes with resources and edges with players. For the class of games that can be represented as trees, we show that the best-response dynamics cannot cycle and that it terminates after O(n^2) steps where n denotes the number of resources. For the class of games represented as cycles, we show that the best response dynamics can cycle. However, we also show that the random best response dynamics terminates after O(n^2) steps in expectation.   Additionally, we conjecture that in general player-specific singleton congestion games there exists no polynomial upper bound on the expected number of steps until the random best response dynamics terminates. We support our conjecture by presenting a family of games for which simulations indicate a super-polynomial convergence time.',\n",

We study the scaling laws for the throughputs and delays of two coexisting wireless networks that operate in the same geographic region. The primary network consists of Poisson distributed legacy users of density n, and the secondary network consists of Poisson distributed cognitive users of density m, with m>n. The primary users have a higher priority to access the spectrum without particular considerations for the secondary users, while the secondary users have to act conservatively in order to limit the interference to the primary users. With a practical assumption that the secondary users only know the locations of the primary transmitters (not the primary receivers), we first show that both networks can achieve the same throughput scaling law as what Gupta and Kumar [1] established for a stand-alone wireless network if proper transmission schemes are deployed, where a certain throughput is achievable for each individual secondary user (i.e., zero outage) with high probability. By using a fluid model, we also show that both networks can achieve the same delay-throughput tradeoff as the optimal one established by El Gamal et al. [2] for a stand-alone wireless network.',\n",

Many advertisers buy advertisements (ads) on the Internet or on traditional media and seek simple, online mechanisms to reserve ad slots in advance. Media publishers represent a vast and varying inventory, and they too seek automatic, online mechanisms for pricing and allocating such reservations. In this paper, we present and study a simple model for auctioning such ad slots in advance. Bidders arrive sequentially and report which slots they are interested in. The seller must decide immediately whether or not to grant a reservation. Our model allows a seller to accept reservations, but possibly cancel the allocations later and pay the bidder a cancellation compensation (bump payment). Our main result is an online mechanism to derive prices and bump payments that is efficient to implement. This mechanism has many desirable properties. It is individually rational; winners have an incentive to be honest and bidding one's true value dominates any lower bid. Our mechanism's efficiency is within a constant fraction of the a posteriori optimally efficient solution. Its revenue is within a constant fraction of the a posteriori revenue of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism.

Two-tier networks, comprising a conventional cellular network overlaid with shorter range hotspots (e.g. femtocells, distributed antennas, or wired relays), offer an economically viable way to improve cellular system capacity. The capacity-limiting factor in such networks is interference. The cross-tier interference between macrocells and femtocells can suffocate the capacity due to the near-far problem, so in practice hotspots should use a different frequency channel than the potentially nearby high-power macrocell users. Centralized or coordinated frequency planning, which is difficult and inefficient even in conventional cellular networks, is all but impossible in a two-tier network. This paper proposes and analyzes an optimum decentralized spectrum allocation policy for two-tier networks that employ frequency division multiple access (including OFDMA). The proposed allocation is optimal in terms of Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE), and is subjected to a sensible Quality of Service (QoS) requirement, which guarantees that both macrocell and femtocell users attain at least a prescribed data rate. Results show the dependence of this allocation on the QoS requirement, hotspot density and the co-channel interference from the macrocell and surrounding femtocells. Design interpretations of this result are provided.',\n",

This paper studies the network throughput and transport delay of a multihop wireless random access network based on a Markov renewal model of packet transportation. We show that the distribution of the source-to-destination (SD) distance plays a critical role in characterizing network performance. We establish necessary and sufficient condition on the SD distance for scalable network throughput, and address the optimal rate allocation issue with fairness and the QoS requirements taken into consideration. In respect to the end-to-end performance, the transport delay is explored in this paper along with network throughput. We characterize the transport delay by relating it to nodal queueing behavior and the SD-distance distribution; the former is a local property while the latter is a global property. In addition, we apply the large deviation theory to derive the tail distribution of transport delay. To put our theory into practical network operation, several traffic scaling laws are provided to demonstrate how network scalability can be achieved by localizing the traffic pattern, and a leaky bucket scheme at the network access is proposed for traffic shaping and flow control.',\n",
              " 'On the Secure Degrees of Freedom in the K-User Gaussian Interference   Channel.  This paper studies the K-user Gaussian interference channel with secrecy constraints. Two distinct network models, namely the interference channel with confidential messages and the one with an external eavesdropper, are analyzed. Using interference alignment along with secrecy pre-coding at each transmitter, it is shown that each user in the network can achieve non-zero secure Degrees of Freedoms (DoFs) in both scenarios. In particular, the proposed coding scheme achieves (K-2)/(2K-2) secure DoFs for each user in the interference channel with confidential messages model, and (K-2)/2K secure DoFs in the case of an external eavesdropper. The fundamental difference between the two scenarios stems from the lack of channel state information (CSI) about the external eavesdropper. Remarkably, the results establish the positive impact of interference on the secrecy capacity of wireless networks.',\n",

              " 'How Many Users should be Turned On in a Multi-Antenna Broadcast Channel?.  This paper considers broadcast channels with L antennas at the base station and m single-antenna users, where L and m are typically of the same order. We assume that only partial channel state information is available at the base station through a finite rate feedback. Our key observation is that the optimal number of on-users (users turned on), say s, is a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and feedback rate. In support of this, an asymptotic analysis is employed where L, m and the feedback rate approach infinity linearly. We derive the asymptotic optimal feedback strategy as well as a realistic criterion to decide which users should be turned on. The corresponding asymptotic throughput per antenna, which we define as the spatial efficiency, turns out to be a function of the number of on-users s, and therefore s must be chosen appropriately. Based on the asymptotics, a scheme is developed for systems with finite many antennas and users. Compared with other studies in which s is presumed constant, our scheme achieves a significant gain. Furthermore, our analysis and scheme are valid for heterogeneous systems where different users may have different path loss coefficients and feedback rates.',\n",

The source operates each of the transmit antennas via finite-capacity links, and likewise the destination is connected to the receiving antennas through capacity-constrained channels. Targeting a nomadic communication scenario, in which the distributed MIMO transceiver is designed to serve different standards or services, transmitters and receivers are assumed to be oblivious to the encoding functions shared by source and destination. Adopting a Gaussian symmetric interference network as the channel model (as for regularly placed transmitters and receivers), achievable rates are investigated and compared with an upper bound. It is concluded that in certain asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes obliviousness of transmitters and receivers does not cause any loss of optimality.',\n",

We discuss error floor asympotics and present a method for improving the performance of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes in the high SNR (error floor) region.   The method is based on Tanner graph covers that do not have trapping sets from the original code. The advantages of the method are that it is universal, as it can be applied to any LDPC code/channel/decoding algorithm and it improves performance at the expense of increasing the code length, without losing the code regularity, without changing the decoding algorithm, and, under certain conditions, without lowering the code rate. The proposed method can be modified to construct convolutional LDPC codes also.   The method is illustrated by modifying Tanner, MacKay and Margulis codes to improve performance on the binary symmetric channel (BSC) under the Gallager B decoding algorithm. Decoding results on AWGN channel are also presented to illustrate that optimizing codes for one channel/decoding algorithm can lead to performance improvement on other channels.',\n",

This paper gives strong statistical evidence that the probability distributions of the execution time of that algorithm exhibits a heavy tail with an hyperbolic probability decay for long executions, which explains the erratic performance of different executions of the algorithm. Three different restart strategies have been incorporated in the algorithm to mitigate the problems associated to heavy tail distributions: the first assumes full knowledge of the execution time probability distribution, the second and third assume no knowledge. These strategies exploit the fact that the probability of finding a solution in short executions is non-negligible and yield a severe reduction, both in the expected execution time (up to one order of magnitude) and in its variance, which is reduced from an infinite to a finite value.',\n",

Concerning the experiments it is argued that the basic dependence between flow and bottleneck width is not a step function but that it is linear and modified by the effect of a psychological phenomenon.

Our main result is a precise characterization of the rate-distortion region when the covariance matrix of the sources satisfies a \"tree-structure\" condition. In this situation, a natural analog-digital separation scheme optimally trades off the distributed quantization rate tuples and the distortion in the reconstruction: each encoder consists of a point-to-point Gaussian vector quantizer followed by a Slepian-Wolf binning encoder. We also provide a partial converse that suggests that the tree structure condition is fundamental.',\n",

The use of mobile sensors is of great relevance for a number of strategic applications devoted to monitoring critical areas where sensors can not be deployed manually. In these networks, each sensor adapts its position on the basis of a local evaluation of the coverage efficiency, thus permitting an autonomous deployment.   Several algorithms have been proposed to deploy mobile sensors over the area of interest. The applicability of these approaches largely depends on a proper formalization of rigorous rules to coordinate sensor movements, solve local conflicts and manage possible failures of communications and devices.   In this paper we introduce P&P, a communication protocol that permits a correct and efficient coordination of sensor movements in agreement with the PUSH&PULL algorithm. We deeply investigate and solve the problems that may occur when coordinating asynchronous local decisions in the presence of an unreliable transmission medium and possibly faulty devices such as in the typical working scenario of mobile sensor networks.   Simulation results show the performance of our protocol under a range of operative settings, including conflict situations, irregularly shaped target areas, and node failures.',\n",

Several approximate policy iteration schemes without value functions, which focus on policy representation using classifiers and address policy learning as a supervised learning problem, have been proposed recently. Finding good policies with such methods requires not only an appropriate classifier, but also reliable examples of best actions, covering the state space sufficiently. Up to this time, little work has been done on appropriate covering schemes and on methods for reducing the sample complexity of such methods, especially in continuous state spaces. This paper focuses on the simplest possible covering scheme (a discretized grid over the state space) and performs a sample-complexity comparison between the simplest (and previously commonly used) rollout sampling allocation strategy, which allocates samples equally at each state under consideration, and an almost as simple method, which allocates samples only as needed and requires significantly fewer samples.',\n",

Social bookmarking systems allow users to organise collections of resources on the Web in a collaborative fashion. The increasing popularity of these systems as well as first insights into their emergent semantics have made them relevant to disciplines like knowledge extraction and ontology learning. The problem of devising methods to measure the semantic relatedness between tags and characterizing it semantically is still largely open. Here we analyze three measures of tag relatedness: tag co-occurrence, cosine similarity of co-occurrence distributions, and FolkRank, an adaptation of the PageRank algorithm to folksonomies. Each measure is computed on tags from a large-scale dataset crawled from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us. To provide a semantic grounding of our findings, a connection to WordNet (a semantic lexicon for the English language) is established by mapping tags into synonym sets of WordNet, and applying there well-known metrics of semantic similarity. Our results clearly expose different characteristics of the selected measures of relatedness, making them applicable to different subtasks of knowledge extraction such as synonym detection or discovery of concept hierarchies.',\n",

A graphical realization of a linear code C consists of an assignment of the coordinates of C to the vertices of a graph, along with a specification of linear state spaces and linear ``local constraint'' codes to be associated with the edges and vertices, respectively, of the graph. The $\\\\k$-complexity of a graphical realization is defined to be the largest dimension of any of its local constraint codes. $\\\\k$-complexity is a reasonable measure of the computational complexity of a sum-product decoding algorithm specified by a graphical realization. The main focus of this paper is on the following problem: given a linear code C and a graph G, how small can the $\\\\k$-complexity of a realization of C on G be? As useful tools for attacking this problem, we introduce the Vertex-Cut Bound, and the notion of ``vc-treewidth'' for a graph, which is closely related to the well-known graph-theoretic notion of treewidth. Using these tools, we derive tight lower bounds on the $\\\\k$-complexity of any realization of C on G. Our bounds enable us to conclude that good error-correcting codes can have low-complexity realizations only on graphs with large vc-treewidth. Along the way, we also prove the interesting result that the ratio of the $\\\\k$-complexity of the best conventional trellis realization of a length-n code C to the $\\\\k$-complexity of the best cycle-free realization of C grows at most logarithmically with codelength n. Such a logarithmic growth rate is, in fact, achievable.\",\n",

We present two tests based on large deviation bounds for the test statistic, while a third is based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic. The test statistic can be computed in quadratic time, although efficient linear time approximations are available. Several classical metrics on distributions are recovered when the function space used to compute the difference in expectations is allowed to be more general (eg. a Banach space). We apply our two-sample tests to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly. Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.',\n",

The classical information-theoretic approach neglects the energy expended in processing the data at the encoder and the decoder and only minimizes the energy required for transmissions. Since there is no cost associated with using more degrees of freedom, the traditionally optimal strategy is to communicate at rate zero.   In this work, we use our recently proposed model for the power consumed by iterative message passing. Using generalized sphere-packing bounds on the decoding power, we find lower bounds on the total energy consumed in the transmissions and the decoding, allowing for freedom in the choice of the rate. We show that contrary to the classical intuition, the rate for green codes is bounded away from zero for any given error probability. In fact, as the desired bit-error probability goes to zero, the optimizing rate for our bounds converges to 1.',\n",

The celebrated multi-armed bandit problem in decision theory models the basic trade-off between exploration, or learning about the state of a system, and exploitation, or utilizing the system. In this paper we study the variant of the multi-armed bandit problem where the exploration phase involves costly experiments and occurs before the exploitation phase; and where each play of an arm during the exploration phase updates a prior belief about the arm. The problem of finding an inexpensive exploration strategy to optimize a certain exploitation objective is NP-Hard even when a single play reveals all information about an arm, and all exploration steps cost the same.   We provide the first polynomial time constant-factor approximation algorithm for this class of problems. We show that this framework also generalizes several problems of interest studied in the context of data acquisition in sensor networks. Our analyses also extends to switching and setup costs, and to concave utility objectives.   Our solution approach is via a novel linear program rounding technique based on stochastic packing. In addition to yielding exploration policies whose performance is within a small constant factor of the adaptive optimal policy, a nice feature of this approach is that the resulting policies explore the arms sequentially without revisiting any arm. Sequentiality is a well-studied concept in decision theory, and is very desirable in domains where multiple explorations can be conducted in parallel, for instance, in the sensor network context.',\n",

Achieving weighted throughput maximization (WTM) through power control has been a long standing open problem in interference-limited wireless networks. The complicated coupling between the mutual interferences of links gives rise to a non-convex optimization problem. Previous work has considered the WTM problem in the high signal to interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) regime, where the problem can be approximated and transformed into a convex optimization problem through proper change of variables. In the general SINR regime, however, the approximation and transformation approach does not work. This paper proposes an algorithm, MAPEL, which globally converges to a global optimal solution of the WTM problem in the general SINR regime. The MAPEL algorithm is designed based on three key observations of the WTM problem: (1) the objective function is monotonically increasing in SINR, (2) the objective function can be transformed into a product of exponentiated linear fraction functions, and (3) the feasible set of the equivalent transformed problem is always normal although not necessarily convex. The MAPLE algorithm finds the desired optimal power control solution by constructing a series of polyblocks that approximate the feasible SINR region in increasing precision. Furthermore, by tuning the approximation factor in MAPEL, we could engineer a desirable tradeoff between optimality and convergence time. MAPEL provides an important benchmark for performance evaluation of other heuristic algorithms targeting the same problem. With the help of MAPEL, we evaluate the performance of several respective algorithms through extensive simulations.',\n",

Multi-hop relay channels use multiple relay stages, each with multiple relay nodes, to facilitate communication between a source and destination. Previously, distributed space-time coding was used to maximize diversity gain. Assuming a low-rate feedback link from the destination to each relay stage and the source, this paper proposes end-to-end antenna selection strategies as an alternative to distributed space-time coding. One-way (where only the source has data for destination) and two-way (where the destination also has data for the source) multi-hop relay channels are considered with both the full-duplex and half duplex relay nodes. End-to-end antenna selection strategies are designed and proven to achieve maximum diversity gain by using a single antenna path (using single antenna of the source, each relay stage and the destination) with the maximum signal-to-noise ratio at the destination. For the half-duplex case, two single antenna paths with the two best signal-to-noise ratios in alternate time slots are used to overcome the rate loss with half-duplex nodes, with a small diversity gain penalty. Finally to answer the question, whether to code (distributed space-time code) or not (the proposed end-to-end antenna selection strategy) in a multi-hop relay channel, end-to-end antenna selection strategy and distributed space-time coding is compared with respect to several important performance metrics.',\n",

They rely mostly on sequential input/output. Bitmaps can be compressed to reduce input/output costs and minimize CPU usage. The most efficient compression techniques are based on run-length encoding (RLE), such as Word-Aligned Hybrid (WAH) compression. This type of compression accelerates logical operations (AND, OR) over the bitmaps. However, run-length encoding is sensitive to the order of the facts. Thus, we propose to sort the fact tables. We review lexicographic, Gray-code, and block-wise sorting. We found that a lexicographic sort improves compression--sometimes generating indexes twice as small--and make indexes several times faster. While sorting takes time, this is partially offset by the fact that it is faster to index a sorted table. Column order is significant: it is generally preferable to put the columns having more distinct values at the beginning. A block-wise sort is much less efficient than a full sort. Moreover, we found that Gray-code sorting is not better than lexicographic sorting when using word-aligned compression.',\n",

Computability logic (CL) (see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html) is a recently launched program for redeveloping logic as a formal theory of computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth that logic has more traditionally been. Formulas in it represent computational problems, \"truth\" means existence of an algorithmic solution, and proofs encode such solutions. Within the line of research devoted to finding axiomatizations for ever more expressive fragments of CL, the present paper introduces a new deductive system CL12 and proves its soundness and completeness with respect to the semantics of CL. Conservatively extending classical predicate calculus and offering considerable additional expressive and deductive power, CL12 presents a reasonable, computationally meaningful, constructive alternative to classical logic as a basis for applied theories. To obtain a model example of such theories, this paper rebuilds the traditional, classical-logic-based Peano arithmetic into a computability-logic-based counterpart.

In this work, we consider error-correcting codes in the projective space, focusing mainly on constant dimension codes. We start with the different representations of subspaces in the projective space. These representations involve matrices in reduced row echelon form, associated binary vectors, and Ferrers diagrams. Based on these representations, we provide a new formula for the computation of the distance between any two subspaces in the projective space. We examine lifted maximum rank distance (MRD) codes, which are nearly optimal constant dimension codes. We prove that a lifted MRD code can be represented in such a way that it forms a block design known as a transversal design. The incidence matrix of the transversal design derived from a lifted MRD code can be viewed as a parity-check matrix of a linear code in the Hamming space. We find the properties of these codes which can be viewed also as LDPC codes. We present new bounds and constructions for constant dimension codes. First, we present a multilevel construction for constant dimension codes, which can be viewed as a generalization of a lifted MRD codes construction. This construction is based on a new type of rank-metric codes, called Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes. Then we derive upper bounds on the size of constant dimension codes which contain the lifted MRD code, and provide a construction for two families of codes, that attain these upper bounds. We generalize the well-known concept of a punctured code for a code in the projective space to obtain large codes which are not constant dimension.

              " \"Success Exponent of Wiretapper: A Tradeoff between Secrecy and   Reliability.  Equivocation rate has been widely used as an information-theoretic measure of security after Shannon[10]. It simplifies problems by removing the effect of atypical behavior from the system. In [9], however, Merhav and Arikan considered the alternative of using guessing exponent to analyze the Shannon's cipher system. Because guessing exponent captures the atypical behavior, the strongest expressible notion of secrecy requires the more stringent condition that the size of the key, instead of its entropy rate, to be equal to the size of the message. The relationship between equivocation and guessing exponent are also investigated in [6][7] but it is unclear which is a better measure, and whether there is a unifying measure of security.   Instead of using equivocation rate or guessing exponent, we study the wiretap channel in [2] using the success exponent, defined as the exponent of a wiretapper successfully learn the secret after making an exponential number of guesses to a sequential verifier that gives yes/no answer to each guess. By extending the coding scheme in [2][5] and the converse proof in [4] with the new Overlap Lemma 5.2, we obtain a tradeoff between secrecy and reliability expressed in terms of lower bounds on the error and success exponents of authorized and respectively unauthorized decoding of the transmitted messages.   From this, we obtain an inner bound to the region of strongly achievable public, private and guessing rate triples for which the exponents are strictly positive. The closure of this region is equivalent to the closure of the region in Theorem 1 of [2] when we treat equivocation rate as the guessing rate. However, it is unclear if the inner bound is tight.\",\n",

The practical importance of this is noted, especially the need to have support tools for television movie writing. We use the Casablanca film script, and scripts from six episodes of CSI (Crime Scene Investigation). For analysis of style and structure, we quantify various central perspectives discussed in McKee\\'s book, \"Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting\". Film scripts offer a useful point of departure for exploration of the analysis of more general narratives. Our methodology, using Correspondence Analysis, and hierarchical clustering, is innovative in a range of areas that we discuss. In particular this work is groundbreaking in taking the qualitative analysis of McKee and grounding this analysis in a quantitative and algorithmic framework.',\n",
              " 'On Metrics for Error Correction in Network Coding.  The problem of error correction in both coherent and noncoherent network coding is considered under an adversarial model. For coherent network coding, where knowledge of the network topology and network code is assumed at the source and destination nodes, the error correction capability of an (outer) code is succinctly described by the rank metric; as a consequence, it is shown that universal network error correcting codes achieving the Singleton bound can be easily constructed and efficiently decoded. For noncoherent network coding, where knowledge of the network topology and network code is not assumed, the error correction capability of a (subspace) code is given exactly by a new metric, called the injection metric, which is closely related to, but different than, the subspace metric of K\\\\\"otter and Kschischang. In particular, in the case of a non-constant-dimension code, the decoder associated with the injection metric is shown to correct more errors then a minimum-subspace-distance decoder. All of these results are based on a general approach to adversarial error correction, which could be useful for other adversarial channels beyond network coding.',\n",

In this paper, we consider the problem of robust joint source-channel coding over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. We propose a new scheme which achieves the optimal slope of the signal-to-distortion (SDR) curve (unlike the previously known coding schemes). Also, we propose a family of robust codes which together maintain a bounded gap with the optimum SDR curve (in terms of dB). To show the importance of this result, we drive some theoretical bounds on the asymptotic performance of delay-limited hybrid digital-analog (HDA) coding schemes. We show that, unlike the delay-unlimited case, for any family of delay-limited HDA codes, the asymptotic performance loss is unbounded (in terms of dB).',\n",

The guiding insight of our work is that unlike an ad hoc wireless network, a wireless ad hoc sensor network does not require full connectivity among the nodes. As long as the sensing region is well covered by connected nodes, the network can perform its task. We consider two kinds of geometric random graphs as base interconnection structures: unit disk graphs $\\\\UDG(2,\\\\lambda)$ and $k$-nearest-neighbor graphs $\\\\NN(2,k)$ built on points generated by a Poisson point process of density $\\\\lambda$ in $\\\\RR^2$. We provide subgraph constructions for these two models $\\\\US(2,\\\\lambda)$ and $\\\\NS(2,k)$ and show that there are values $\\\\lambda_s$ and $k_s$ above which these constructions have the following good properties: (i) they are sparse; (ii) they are power-efficient in the sense that the graph distance is no more than a constant times the Euclidean distance between any pair of points; (iii) they cover the space well; (iv) the subgraphs can be set up easily using local information at each node. We also describe a simple local algorithm for routing packets on these subgraphs.

Motivated, in part, by the desire to develop an information-theoretic foundation for compound Poisson approximation limit theorems (analogous to the corresponding developments for the central limit theorem and for simple Poisson approximation), this work examines sufficient conditions under which the compound Poisson distribution has maximal entropy within a natural class of probability measures on the nonnegative integers. We show that the natural analog of the Poisson maximum entropy property remains valid if the measures under consideration are log-concave, but that it fails in general. A parallel maximum entropy result is established for the family of compound binomial measures. The proofs are largely based on ideas related to the semigroup approach introduced in recent work by Johnson for the Poisson family. Sufficient conditions are given for compound distributions to be log-concave, and specific examples are presented illustrating all the above results.',\n",

              " 'On the Capacity of Wireless Multicast Networks.  The problem of maximizing the average rate in a multicast network subject to a coverage constraint (minimum quality of service) is studied. Assuming the channel state information is available only at the receiver side and single antenna nodes, the highest expected rate achievable by a random user in the network, called expected typical rate, is derived in two scenarios: hard coverage constraint and soft coverage constraint. In the first case, the coverage is expressed in terms of the outage probability, while in the second case, the expected rate should satisfy certain minimum requirement. It is shown that the optimum solution in both cases (achieving the highest expected typical rate for given coverage requirements) is achieved by an infinite layer superposition code for which the optimum power allocation among the different layers is derived. For the MISO case, a suboptimal coding scheme is proposed, which is shown to be asymptotically optimal, when the number of transmit antennas grows at least logarithmically with the number of users in the network.',\n",
              " 'Network Connection Games with Disconnected Equilibria.  In this paper we extend a popular non-cooperative network creation game (NCG) to allow for disconnected equilibrium networks. There are n players, each is a vertex in a graph, and a strategy is a subset of players to build edges to. For each edge a player must pay a cost \\\\alpha, and the individual cost for a player represents a trade-off between edge costs and shortest path lengths to all other players. We extend the model to a penalized game (PCG), for which we reduce the penalty counted towards the individual cost for a pair of disconnected players to a finite value \\\\beta. Our analysis concentrates on existence, structure, and cost of disconnected Nash and strong equilibria. Although the PCG is not a potential game, pure Nash equilibria always and pure strong equilibria very often exist. We provide tight conditions under which disconnected Nash (strong) equilibria can evolve. Components of these equilibria must be Nash (strong) equilibria of a smaller NCG. However, in contrast to the NCG, for almost all parameter values no tree is a stable component. Finally, we present a detailed characterization of the price of anarchy that reveals cases in which the price of anarchy is \\\\Theta(n) and thus several orders of magnitude larger than in the NCG. Perhaps surprisingly, the strong price of anarchy increases to at most 4. This indicates that global communication and coordination can be extremely valuable to overcome socially inferior topologies in distributed selfish network design.',\n",
              " 'Capacity Bounds for Broadcast Channels with Confidential Messages.  In this paper, we study capacity bounds for discrete memoryless broadcast channels with confidential messages. Two private messages as well as a common message are transmitted; the common message is to be decoded by both receivers, while each private message is only for its intended receiver. In addition, each private message is to be kept secret from the unintended receiver where secrecy is measured by equivocation. We propose both inner and outer bounds to the rate equivocation region for broadcast channels with confidential messages. The proposed inner bound generalizes Csisz\\\\\\'{a}r and K\\\\\"{o}rner\\'s rate equivocation region for broadcast channels with a single confidential message, Liu {\\\\em et al}\\'s achievable rate region for broadcast channels with perfect secrecy, Marton\\'s and Gel\\'fand and Pinsker\\'s achievable rate region for general broadcast channels. Our proposed outer bounds, together with the inner bound, helps establish the rate equivocation region of several classes of discrete memoryless broadcast channels with confidential messages, including less noisy, deterministic, and semi-deterministic channels. Furthermore, specializing to the general broadcast channel by removing the confidentiality constraint, our proposed outer bounds reduce to new capacity outer bounds for the discrete memory broadcast channel.',\n",
              " 'Low-Complexity Structured Precoding for Spatially Correlated MIMO   Channels.  The focus of this paper is on spatial precoding in correlated multi-antenna channels, where the number of independent data-streams is adapted to trade-off the data-rate with the transmitter complexity. Towards the goal of a low-complexity implementation, a structured precoder is proposed, where the precoder matrix evolves fairly slowly at a rate comparable with the statistical evolution of the channel. Here, the eigenvectors of the precoder matrix correspond to the dominant eigenvectors of the transmit covariance matrix, whereas the power allocation across the modes is fixed, known at both the ends, and is of low-complexity. A particular case of the proposed scheme (semiunitary precoding), where the spatial modes are excited with equal power, is shown to be near-optimal in matched channels. A matched channel is one where the dominant eigenvalues of the transmit covariance matrix are well-conditioned and their number equals the number of independent data-streams, and the receive covariance matrix is also well-conditioned. In mismatched channels, where the above conditions are not met, it is shown that the loss in performance with semiunitary precoding when compared with a perfect channel information benchmark is substantial. This loss needs to be mitigated via limited feedback techniques that provide partial channel information to the transmitter. More importantly, we develop matching metrics that capture the degree of matching of a channel to the precoder structure continuously, and allow ordering two matrix channels in terms of their mutual information or error probability performance.',\n",

It is proved that over any erasure channel (with or without memory), Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes achieve the minimum probability of error (assuming maximum likelihood decoding). Assuming a memoryless erasure channel, the error exponent of MDS codes are compared with that of random codes and linear random codes. It is shown that the envelopes of all these exponents are identical for rates above the critical rate. Noting the optimality of MDS codes, it is concluded that both random codes and linear random codes are exponentially optimal, whether the block sizes is larger or smaller than the alphabet size.',\n",
              " 'Exact Matrix Completion via Convex Optimization.  We consider a problem of considerable practical interest: the recovery of a data matrix from a sampling of its entries. Suppose that we observe m entries selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and recover the entries that we have not seen?   We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of sampled entries obeys m >= C n^{1.2} r log n for some positive numerical constant C, then with very high probability, most n by n matrices of rank r can be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well. Our results are connected with the recent literature on compressed sensing, and show that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed from very limited information.',\n",

In this case, a lower bound for the minimum determinant is given by the minimum Hamming distance. The description of the ring structure of the quotients suggests further optimization in order to improve the overall distribution of determinants.

This channel is motivated by point-to-point communication between two terminals that are embedded in the same chip. Transmission heats up the entire chip and hence increases the thermal noise at the receiver. The capacity of this channel (both with and without feedback) is studied at low transmit powers and at high transmit powers.   At low transmit powers, the slope of the capacity-vs-power curve at zero is computed and it is shown that the heating-up effect is beneficial. At high transmit powers, conditions are determined under which the capacity is bounded, i.e., under which the capacity does not grow to infinity as the allowed average power tends to infinity.',\n",
              " \"Community Detection using a Measure of Global Influence.  The growing popularity of online social networks has provided researchers with access to large amount of social network data. This, coupled with the ever increasing computation speed, storage capacity and data mining capabilities, led to the renewal of interest in automatic community detection methods. Surprisingly, there is no universally accepted definition of the community. One frequently used definition states that ``communities, that have more and/or better-connected `internal edges' connecting members of the set than `cut edges' connecting the set to the rest of the world''[Leskovec et al. 20008]. This definition inspired the modularity-maximization class of community detection algorithms, which look for regions of the network that have higher than expected density of edges within them. We introduce an alternative definition which states that a community is composed of individuals who have more influence on others within the community than on those outside of it. We present a mathematical formulation of influence, define an influence-based modularity metric, and show how to use it to partition the network into communities. We evaluated our approach on the standard data sets used in literature, and found that it often outperforms the edge-based modularity algorithm.\",\n",
              " 'Uplink Macro Diversity of Limited Backhaul Cellular Network.  In this work new achievable rates are derived, for the uplink channel of a cellular network with joint multicell processing, where unlike previous results, the ideal backhaul network has finite capacity per-cell. Namely, the cell sites are linked to the central joint processor via lossless links with finite capacity. The cellular network is abstracted by symmetric models, which render analytical treatment plausible. For this idealistic model family, achievable rates are presented for cell-sites that use compress-and-forward schemes combined with local decoding, for both Gaussian and fading channels. The rates are given in closed form for the classical Wyner model and the soft-handover model. These rates are then demonstrated to be rather close to the optimal unlimited backhaul joint processing rates, already for modest backhaul capacities, supporting the potential gain offered by the joint multicell processing approach. Particular attention is also given to the low-SNR characterization of these rates through which the effect of the limited backhaul network is explicitly revealed. In addition, the rate at which the backhaul capacity should scale in order to maintain the original high-SNR characterization of an unlimited backhaul capacity system is found.',\n",

              " \"Sincere-Strategy Preference-Based Approval Voting Fully Resists   Constructive Control and Broadly Resists Destructive Control.  We study sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting (SP-AV), a system proposed by Brams and Sanver [Electoral Studies, 25(2):287-305, 2006], and here adjusted so as to coerce admissibility of the votes (rather than excluding inadmissible votes a priori), with respect to procedural control. In such control scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election via actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters. SP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of candidates, where in elections with at least two candidates the voters' approval strategies are adjusted--if needed--to approve of their most-preferred candidate and to disapprove of their least-preferred candidate. This rule coerces admissibility of the votes even in the presence of control actions, and hybridizes, in effect, approval with pluralitiy voting.   We prove that this system is computationally resistant (i.e., the corresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of constructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to control than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a polynomial-time winner problem. In particular, SP-AV is (after Copeland voting, see Faliszewski et al. [AAIM-2008, Springer LNCS 5034, pp. 165-176, 2008]) the second natural voting system with an easy winner-determination procedure that is known to have full resistance to constructive control, and unlike Copeland voting it in addition displays broad resistance to destructive control.\",\n",
              " 'Multirate Synchronous Sampling of Sparse Multiband Signals.  Recent advances in optical systems make them ideal for undersampling multiband signals that have high bandwidths. In this paper we propose a new scheme for reconstructing multiband sparse signals using a small number of sampling channels. The scheme, which we call synchronous multirate sampling (SMRS), entails gathering samples synchronously at few different rates whose sum is significantly lower than the Nyquist sampling rate. The signals are reconstructed by solving a system of linear equations. We have demonstrated an accurate and robust reconstruction of signals using a small number of sampling channels that operate at relatively high rates. Sampling at higher rates increases the signal to noise ratio in samples. The SMRS scheme enables a significant reduction in the number of channels required when the sampling rate increases. We have demonstrated, using only three sampling channels, an accurate sampling and reconstruction of 4 real signals (8 bands). The matrices that are used to reconstruct the signals in the SMRS scheme also have low condition numbers. This indicates that the SMRS scheme is robust to noise in signals. The success of the SMRS scheme relies on the assumption that the sampled signals are sparse. As a result most of the sampled spectrum may be unaliased in at least one of the sampling channels. This is in contrast to multicoset sampling schemes in which an alias in one channel is equivalent to an alias in all channels. We have demonstrated that the SMRS scheme obtains similar performance using 3 sampling channels and a total sampling rate 8 times the Landau rate to an implementation of a multicoset sampling scheme that uses 6 sampling channels with a total sampling rate of 13 times the Landau rate.',\n",
              " 'Information-theoretic limits on sparse signal recovery: Dense versus   sparse measurement matrices.  We study the information-theoretic limits of exactly recovering the support of a sparse signal using noisy projections defined by various classes of measurement matrices. Our analysis is high-dimensional in nature, in which the number of observations $n$, the ambient signal dimension $p$, and the signal sparsity $k$ are all allowed to tend to infinity in a general manner. This paper makes two novel contributions. First, we provide sharper necessary conditions for exact support recovery using general (non-Gaussian) dense measurement matrices. Combined with previously known sufficient conditions, this result yields sharp characterizations of when the optimal decoder can recover a signal for various scalings of the sparsity $k$ and sample size $n$, including the important special case of linear sparsity ($k = \\\\Theta(p)$) using a linear scaling of observations ($n = \\\\Theta(p)$). Our second contribution is to prove necessary conditions on the number of observations $n$ required for asymptotically reliable recovery using a class of $\\\\gamma$-sparsified measurement matrices, where the measurement sparsity $\\\\gamma(n, p, k) \\\\in (0,1]$ corresponds to the fraction of non-zero entries per row. Our analysis allows general scaling of the quadruplet $(n, p, k, \\\\gamma)$, and reveals three different regimes, corresponding to whether measurement sparsity has no effect, a minor effect, or a dramatic effect on the information-theoretic limits of the subset recovery problem.',\n",
              " \"On Peak versus Average Interference Power Constraints for Protecting   Primary Users in Cognitive Radio Networks.  This paper considers spectrum sharing for wireless communication between a cognitive radio (CR) link and a primary radio (PR) link. It is assumed that the CR protects the PR transmission by applying the so-called interference-temperature constraint, whereby the CR is allowed to transmit regardless of the PR's on/off status provided that the resultant interference power level at the PR receiver is kept below some predefined threshold. For the fading PR and CR channels, the interference-power constraint at the PR receiver is usually one of the following two types: One is to regulate the average interference power (AIP) over all the fading states, while the other is to limit the peak interference power (PIP) at each fading state. From the CR's perspective, given the same average and peak power threshold, the AIP constraint is more favorable than the PIP counterpart because of its more flexibility for dynamically allocating transmit powers over the fading states. On the contrary, from the perspective of protecting the PR, the more restrictive PIP constraint appears at a first glance to be a better option than the AIP. Some surprisingly, this paper shows that in terms of various forms of capacity limits achievable for the PR fading channel, e.g., the ergodic and outage capacities, the AIP constraint is also superior over the PIP. This result is based upon an interesting interference diversity phenomenon, i.e., randomized interference powers over the fading states in the AIP case are more advantageous over deterministic ones in the PIP case for minimizing the resultant PR capacity losses. Therefore, the AIP constraint results in larger fading channel capacities than the PIP for both the CR and PR transmissions.\",\n",

In addition we show that the same universal behavior occurs when citation distributions of articles published in the same field, but in different years, are compared.

A dynamic measurement-based EDCA parameter adaptation block lies in the core of this framework. The proposed framework is unique in the sense that it considers the characteristic differences of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows and the coexistence of stations with varying bandwidth or Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Via simulations, we show that our solution provides short- and long-term fair access for all stations in the uplink and downlink employing TCP and UDP flows with non-uniform packet rates in a wired-wireless heterogeneous network. In the meantime, the QoS requirements of coexisting real-time flows are also maintained.',\n",
              " 'Belief Propagation and Beyond for Particle Tracking.  We describe a novel approach to statistical learning from particles tracked while moving in a random environment. The problem consists in inferring properties of the environment from recorded snapshots. We consider here the case of a fluid seeded with identical passive particles that diffuse and are advected by a flow. Our approach rests on efficient algorithms to estimate the weighted number of possible matchings among particles in two consecutive snapshots, the partition function of the underlying graphical model. The partition function is then maximized over the model parameters, namely diffusivity and velocity gradient. A Belief Propagation (BP) scheme is the backbone of our algorithm, providing accurate results for the flow parameters we want to learn. The BP estimate is additionally improved by incorporating Loop Series (LS) contributions. For the weighted matching problem, LS is compactly expressed as a Cauchy integral, accurately estimated by a saddle point approximation. Numerical experiments show that the quality of our improved BP algorithm is comparable to the one of a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme, based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, while the BP-based scheme is substantially faster than the MCMC scheme.',\n",

Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting, and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited thanks to the lack of tools to monitor the time resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six month period. We find that in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Levy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time independent characteristic length scale and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent based modeling.',\n",

We study also decision problems, the links with the notions of ambiguity and of degrees of ambiguity, and the special case of omega-powers.',\n",

We review the state-of-the art of research and application of superdistribution and propose systematic approach to market mechanisms using super-distribution and technical system architectures supporting it. The limiting conditions on such markets are of economic, legal, technical, and psychological nature.',\n",
              " \"Bits through ARQs.  A fundamental problem in dynamic frequency reuse is that the cognitive radio is ignorant of the amount of interference it inflicts on the primary license holder. A model for such a situation is proposed and analyzed. The primary sends packets across an erasure channel and employs simple ACK/NAK feedback (ARQs) to retransmit erased packets. Furthermore, its erasure probabilities are influenced by the cognitive radio's activity. While the cognitive radio does not know these interference characteristics, it can eavesdrop on the primary's ARQs. The model leads to strategies in which the cognitive radio adaptively adjusts its input based on the primary's ARQs thereby guaranteeing the primary exceeds a target packet rate. A relatively simple strategy whereby the cognitive radio transmits only when the primary's empirical packet rate exceeds a threshold is shown to have interesting universal properties in the sense that for unknown time-varying interference characteristics, the primary is guaranteed to meet its target rate. Furthermore, a more intricate version of this strategy is shown to be capacity-achieving for the cognitive radio when the interference characteristics are time-invariant.\",\n",
              " 'The injectivity of the global function of a cellular automaton in the   hyperbolic plane is undecidable.  In this paper, we look at the following question. We consider cellular automata in the hyperbolic plane and we consider the global function defined on all possible configurations. Is the injectivity of this function undecidable? The problem was answered positively in the case of the Euclidean plane by Jarkko Kari, in 1994. In the present paper, we show that the answer is also positive for the hyperbolic plane: the problem is undecidable.',\n",
              " 'Effect of spatial structure on the evolution of cooperation.  Spatial structure is known to have an impact on the evolution of cooperation, and so it has been intensively studied during recent years. Previous work has shown the relevance of some features, such as the synchronicity of the updating, the clustering of the network or the influence of the update rule. This has been done, however, for concrete settings with particular games, networks and update rules, with the consequence that some contradictions have arisen and a general understanding of these topics is missing in the broader context of the space of 2x2 games. To address this issue, we have performed a systematic and exhaustive simulation in the different degrees of freedom of the problem. In some cases, we generalize previous knowledge to the broader context of our study and explain the apparent contradictions. In other cases, however, our conclusions refute what seems to be established opinions in the field, as for example the robustness of the effect of spatial structure against changes in the update rule, or offer new insights into the subject, e.g. the relation between the intensity of selection and the asymmetry between the effects on games with mixed equilibria.',\n",
              " 'Self-overlapping Curves Revisited.  A surface embedded in space, in such a way that each point has a neighborhood within which the surface is a terrain, projects to an immersed surface in the plane, the boundary of which is a self-intersecting curve. Under what circumstances can we reverse these mappings algorithmically? Shor and van Wyk considered one such problem, determining whether a curve is the boundary of an immersed disk; they showed that the self-overlapping curves defined in this way can be recognized in polynomial time. We show that several related problems are more difficult: it is NP-complete to determine whether an immersed disk is the projection of a surface embedded in space, or whether a curve is the boundary of an immersed surface in the plane that is not constrained to be a disk. However, when a casing is supplied with a self-intersecting curve, describing which component of the curve lies above and which below at each crossing, we may determine in time linear in the number of crossings whether the cased curve forms the projected boundary of a surface in space. As a related result, we show that an immersed surface with a single boundary curve that crosses itself n times has at most 2^{n/2} combinatorially distinct spatial embeddings, and we discuss the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for related problems.',\n",
              " 'Bounded Budget Connection (BBC) Games or How to make friends and   influence people, on a budget.  Motivated by applications in social networks, peer-to-peer and overlay networks, we define and study the Bounded Budget Connection (BBC) game - we have a collection of n players or nodes each of whom has a budget for purchasing links; each link has a cost as well as a length and each node has a set of preference weights for each of the remaining nodes; the objective of each node is to use its budget to buy a set of outgoing links so as to minimize its sum of preference-weighted distances to the remaining nodes.   We study the structural and complexity-theoretic properties of pure Nash equilibria in BBC games. We show that determining the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium in general BBC games is NP-hard. However, in a natural variant, fractional BBC games - where it is permitted to buy fractions of links - a pure Nash equilibrium always exists. A major focus is the study of (n,k)-uniform BBC games - those in which all link costs, link lengths and preference weights are equal (to 1) and all budgets are equal (to k). We show that a pure Nash equilibrium or stable graph exists for all (n,k)-uniform BBC games and that all stable graphs are essentially fair (i.e. all nodes have similar costs). We provide an explicit construction of a family of stable graphs that spans the spectrum from minimum total social cost to maximum total social cost. We also study a special family of regular graphs in which all nodes imitate the \"same\" buying pattern, and show that if n is sufficiently large no such regular graph can be a pure Nash equilibrium. We analyze best-response walks on the configuration defined by the uniform game. Lastly, we extend our results to the case where each node seeks to minimize its maximum distance to the other nodes.',\n",
              " \"A Low-Complexity, Full-Rate, Full-Diversity 2 X 2 STBC with Golden   Code's Coding Gain.  This paper presents a low-ML-decoding-complexity, full-rate, full-diversity space-time block code (STBC) for a 2 transmit antenna, 2 receive antenna multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, with coding gain equal to that of the best and well known Golden code for any QAM constellation. Recently, two codes have been proposed (by Paredes, Gershman and Alkhansari and by Sezginer and Sari), which enjoy a lower decoding complexity relative to the Golden code, but have lesser coding gain. The $2\\\\times 2$ STBC presented in this paper has lesser decoding complexity for non-square QAM constellations, compared with that of the Golden code, while having the same decoding complexity for square QAM constellations. Compared with the Paredes-Gershman-Alkhansari and Sezginer-Sari codes, the proposed code has the same decoding complexity for non-rectangular QAM constellations. Simulation results, which compare the codeword error rate (CER) performance, are presented.\",\n",

This paper proposes a low decoding complexity, full-diversity and full-rate space-time block code (STBC) for 4 transmit and 2 receive ($4\\\\times 2$) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. For such systems, the best code known is the DjABBA code and recently, Biglieri, Hong and Viterbo have proposed another STBC (BHV code) which has lower decoding complexity than DjABBA but does not have full-diversity like the DjABBA code. The code proposed in this paper has the same decoding complexity as the BHV code for square QAM constellations but has full-diversity as well. Compared to the best code in the DjABBA family of codes, our code has lower decoding complexity, a better coding gain and hence a better error performance as well. Simulation results confirming these are presented.',\n",
